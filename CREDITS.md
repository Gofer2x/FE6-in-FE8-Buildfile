Various scripts and macros/definitions taken from other projects. I've kept credits in ones that had them, but most of them I found from github searches and they appeared in multiple repos, so not sure how to credit them. But thank you.

Also thanks to Vesly for their great .bat files for processing data, and the various people on the FEU discord for helping out when I ran into problems.
