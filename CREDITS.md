    Portrait Upshift Edit(or?) <- got this one from Github search but couldn't find a proper source?



Various scripts and macros/definitions taken from other projects. I've kept credits in ones that had them, but most of them I found from github searches and they appeared in multiple repos, so not sure how to credit them. But thank you.

Thanks to the Fire Emblem Wiki (https://fireemblemwiki.org/) for various information about specific chapters and mechanics. Ch14x's bridges, Ch16x's arrow trap timings, Ch21's reinforcement zones and probably more.

Also thanks to Vesly for their great .bat files for processing data, and the various people on the FEU discord for helping out when I ran into problems.
