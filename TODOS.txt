on the gay agenda, from highest to lowest priority (aka how much i feel like it):

new item table is waiting in a folder outside of project, but i'll need to do some extra nonsense for it first.
namely, rebuild class animations table. that's gonna be fun.
also start phasing out using vanilla data for most things if possible. mainly text.
in other words, add item names, descs, use descs for all items. then comment out the #includes for the vanilla data to cehck what's missing. the usual.

move as many definition files into the definitions folder and organize into folders
especially the vanilla data ones



supports

actually implementing supports


character palettes

character promotions aka promotion tables

change sacred weapon effectiveness to x3 and repoint to the new legendaries (for the shine effect)

for tables that are replaced in their entirety, generate one on the fly with FILL instead of having a .dmp. so applies to stuff like map sprites and mugs, but not to text and battle anims.

harp and birdie sounds for elffin animation


manakete anims



experimental: since i only use my own map and tileset data, use the space for it all in the original rom as free space?
this also can apply to much more like mugs. it would need some tinkering and counting, but could save a decent bit of space.
