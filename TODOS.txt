The Gay agenda:

HIGH PRIORITY
Finish Epilogue work.
Idunn's dragon mug is glitched?
Re-add some items like the Metis' tome and Earth Seal.
Fae and Idunn dragon animations.
Write scripts to autogenerate MMS and footstep tables.



MEDIUM PRIORITY
FE6 has different animations for the following classes:
	Mercenary
	Bishop (has hat + unique staff anim)
	BishopF (unique staff anim)
	MageF
	Sage
	SageF
	Shaman, Druid, ShamanF and DruidF have different palettes.
Implement Triangle attack text.
Apocalypse's icon is bugged.



LOW PRIORITY
Ch16x background.
Music and Audio insertion via FEBuilder in CMD mode. 
Bard and Dancer map sounds are weird.
Slight visual bug with ballista ammo counter. Terrain info overlaps it.
Recruitable characters only go up so high. Double check the limit against current amount and Trial characters (possibly culling then).
The "Custom Game Over" thing is a bit messy. Try to fix it up. The reason I can't put the character check thing as Roy's death quote is that CHECK_DEPLOYED seems to exit the function early from that context?
World map. This is a big one but really not a priority right now.



NEED PATCHES
Add Binding Blade check for Idunn.
Recruitable Character HM bonuses.
Bugged (doubled) early HM bonuses.
Add IER...?
Let thieves Steal regardless of Speed.
Ch21x traps...? Some might be possible to recreate with eventing, but not all for sure.



MISC
Brigand and Berserker promos have been merged. In FE6 they're slightly different.
Torch staff currently has FE8 behavior. Though is this really worth changing...?
All enemies with FE6 specific AI (Galle, the Ch2/23 gate enemies..) have more standard AI.
Free space management and overwriting now-unused vanilla data.
