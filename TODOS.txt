on the gay agenda, from highest to lowest priority (aka how much i feel like it):

final chapter and epilogue(s)

add some items back. like metis tome (id 0x89), gold bags, usable earth seal (id 0x88).
roy seal config?
IER???? skillsys???????

idunn dragon mug bungled

i wrote a patch for getting exp amount from unit data but doesn't work. fix it

fe6 different battle sprites:
mercenary
bishop (has hat, + different staff anim)
bishop f (needs different staff anim)
mage f
sage
sage f
shaman, druid (m and f) have different palettes

triangle attack doesn't have text?

manakete anims

harp and birdie sounds for elffin animation

recruitable characters only go up to 63/0x3F i think. so it might be worth culling the trial chars (and doing a dummy for guinivere) to make room for new recruitables?

bard and dancer map sounds are weird

different length fade ins and fadeouts? rn all are just 60 i think

slight visual bug with ballista ammo counter (also shows terrain info i think)

world map lol. i am in uhh no rush though

recruitable character hm bonuses and bugged early hm bonuses need modified/new patch to work.

there is now a custom game over event for the extra character dialogue, but because of how it's set up it only plays after roy has disappeared from the map. when i tried calling the dialogue event as a death event, it would exit early because i think CHECK_DEPLOYED wouldn't work properly. dunno maybe look into it at some point.

experimental: since i only use my own map and tileset data, use the space for it all in the original rom as free space?
this also can apply to much more like mugs. it would need some tinkering and counting, but could save a decent bit of space.
that's definitely the plan btw.




note on differences from fe6:
the double hard mode bonuses in the first few chapters are not implemented. i will need a patch that can handle multiple units at once for that.

torch staff has fe8 behavior. needs a patch ig.

thieves need higher speed to steal. this will need a patch to be changed.

brigand and pirate berserker promo have different stat bonuses in fe6, but i had to combine them here.

all the enemies with the wacky "ghost of bern" ai have more standard ai instead.
ditto with galle and his squad's ai. might change this eventually if a need arises.
