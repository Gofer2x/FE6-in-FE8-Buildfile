class stuff:
do i want to tear up the whole class table and remake it from scratch? yes, it's a lot of work, but i'll have to change the stats and growths on all classes anyway and the monster/fe8 exclusive ones get in the way. might have to go about it that way. 
but yes, for new classes that will need map sprites and anims:
nomads and nomad troopers (4 total)
roy lord and master lord
female thief
manakete classes. i think there are 5 total needed, 2 for fae (normal and map anims), ditto for enemy manaketes, and 1 for idunn.
bard and dancer
. due to how moving map anims work, this means i'll have to repoint them all as well. have a def with all moving class anims addresses.

animations:
expand animation table?
certainly don't remake the whole animations table, though. too big of a hassle. just keep track of all vanilla pointers and the ones i add.
speaking of which,
roy lord and master lord
axe for paladin
female thief
female hero
female shaman
female druid
fae manakete
fire manakete
idunn
zephiel
bard and dancer

music:
all of it.

maps:
tile change names in the western isles village chapters


patches:
mainly easy to install stuff that changes things like the convoy character. leave all the advanced stuff to the experts.
