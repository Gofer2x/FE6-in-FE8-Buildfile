The Gay agenda:

HIGH PRIORITY
Finish Epilogue work.
Idunn's dragon mug is glitched?
Re-add some items like the Metis' tome and Earth Seal.
Insert remaining Sounds for battle animations and make sure all hardcoded ones work.



MEDIUM PRIORITY
Install the FE6-style background patch once I can get the WSL environment working.
FE6 has different animations for the following classes:
	Shaman, Druid, ShamanF and DruidF have different palettes.
Implement Triangle attack text.
Apocalypse's icon is bugged.
Start managing the free space created by unused vanilla assets to save on ROM space.


LOW PRIORITY
Ch16x background.
Bard and Dancer map sounds are weird.
Slight visual bug with ballista ammo counter. Terrain info overlaps it.
Recruitable characters only go up so high. Double check the limit against current amount and Trial characters (possibly culling then).
The "Custom Game Over" thing is a bit messy. Try to fix it up. The reason I can't put the character check thing as Roy's death quote is that CHECK_DEPLOYED seems to exit the function early from that context?
World map. This is a big one but really not a priority right now.



NEED PATCHES
Add Binding Blade check for Idunn.
Recruitable Character HM bonuses.
Bugged (doubled) early HM bonuses.
Add IER...?
Let thieves Steal regardless of Speed.
Ch21x traps...? Some might be possible to recreate with eventing, but not all for sure.
Is there some way to bypass the palette limitations for Fae's animations?



MISC
Brigand and Berserker promos have been merged. In FE6 they're slightly different.
Torch staff currently has FE8 behavior. Though is this really worth changing...?
All enemies with FE6 specific AI (Galle, the Ch2/23 gate enemies..) have more standard AI.
