on the gay agenda, from highest to lowest priority (aka how much i feel like it):

chapters

supports

actually implementing supports

king animation broken. too big

roy special death quote? give it a special event?

harp and birdie sounds for elffin animation

bard and dancer map sounds are weird

different length fade ins and fadeouts? rn all are just 60 i think

slight visual bug with ballista ammo counter (also shows terrain info i think)

manakete anims

the mugs for the female villager in hat and bangs seem to dislike being palette swaps of each other. their binary data seems different. also one is missing (villager13). i've messed around with them a bunch and i think it's that some of them from the repo have a slight offset and that the first one only has 15 colors which messes things up. i've made htem not palette swaps for the time being, just leave them for now

world map lol. i am in uhh no rush though

recruitable character hm bonuses and bugged early hm bonuses need modified/new patch to work.



experimental: since i only use my own map and tileset data, use the space for it all in the original rom as free space?
this also can apply to much more like mugs. it would need some tinkering and counting, but could save a decent bit of space.





note on differences from fe6:
the double hard mode bonuses in the first few chapters are not implemented. i will need a patch that can handle multiple units at once for that.

torch staff has fe8 behavior. needs a patch ig.

thieves need higher speed to steal. this will need a patch to be changed.

brigand and pirate berserker promo have different stat bonuses in fe6, but i had to combine them here.

all the enemies with the wacky "ghost of bern" ai have more standard ai instead.
ditto with galle and squad ai. might change this eventually if a need arises.
