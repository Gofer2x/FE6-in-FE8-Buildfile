on the gay agenda, from highest to lowest priority (aka how much i feel like it):

reorganize item table entirely. can keep the funny dummy and vanilla items, just move the ones that will certainly stay unused to the bottom.

item changes
	:checkmark: all existing weapons had stats changed
	to be implemented:
	aircalibur
	legendary weapons + binding blade
	firestone, divinestone, idunn weapon
	eckehehsshashsh

move as many definition files into the definitions folder and organize into folders
especially the vanilla data ones


death quotes for characters
death quotes for bosses

battle quotes for bosses
specific battle quotes for bosses

supports

actually implementing the 5 above (create bigger tables and repoint the nmm files for all probably)


effectiveness changes tables things (look at image in root)

for tables that are replaced in their entirety, generate one on the fly with FILL instead of having a .dmp. so applies to stuff like map sprites and mugs, but not to text and battle anims.

harp and birdie sounds for elffin animation


manakete anims



experimental: since i only use my own map and tileset data, use the space for it all in the original rom as free space?
this also can apply to much more like mugs. it would need some tinkering and counting, but could save a decent bit of space.
