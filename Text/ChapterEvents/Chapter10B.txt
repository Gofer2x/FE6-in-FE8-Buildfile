[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you found that[N]
resistance bard yet?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We have a good[N]
lead, milord.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Out with it then.[N]
Where is he?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's apparently in hiding[N]
in the nearby village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Removing Elffin the Bard will sever the[N]
head guiding the resistance force.[AN]
Find him. Burn the village to the[N]
ground if you have to![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I apologize for the[N]
wait, Madam Melady.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You seem to have...[N]
a full plate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh, worry not, our obligations[N]
to Bern take priority over all.[AN]
If you need anything, please[N]
don't hesitate to ask.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Then let's get to the matter[N]
we discussed earlier...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, the whereabouts[N]
of Princess Guinivere.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you found anything,[N]
Lord Zinque?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I regret to say[N]
that I have not.[AN]
Have you been to Juteaux?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I have.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then I suggest you pay[N]
a visit to Father Orlo.[AN]
He resides in the castle at[N]
Eburacum to the north.[AN]
He knows the region better than any[N]
of us, so he may have some idea.[AN]
However, if even he does not know[N]
where Princess Guinivere might be,[AN]
then she is most likely not in[N]
the Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[AN]
I will speak with[N]
Father Orlo then.[AN]
Farewell.[AN]

## Ch10B_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The resistance is supposedly[N]
very active in this area.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's what our[N]
sources say.[AN]
But I also hear that Etruria's military is[N]
hunting down members of the resistance.[AN]
Their numbers have apparently dwindled.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Etruria does nothing about bandits but[N]
oppresses the resistance?[AN]
Something is very wrong with[N]
this picture...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed it is.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Can we do anything to[N]
help the resistance?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Our hands are tied...[AN]
To do so would directly oppose[N]
Etruria's nobility.[AN]
We are here under Etruria's[N]
orders, remember.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'll send a letter to General Cecilia[N]
and see what she has to say.[AN]
Let's not do anything too[N]
rash just yet.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy![AN]
Etrurian troops are attacking the village[N]
to find a member of the resistance force![AN]
They're under orders from Lord Zinque,[N]
the noble who controls this area.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]Oh no![AN]
...But should we intervene?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We haven't the time to[N]
await General Cecilia's reply...[AN]
But I want to help the people.[AN]
...Even if it means opposing[N]
an Etrurian noble.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We fight![AN]
Our purpose is just![N]
Make Lycia proud![AN][X]


## Ch10B_MeladyGalleLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were you able to ascertain[N]
Princess Guinivere's whereabouts?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately, no.[AN]
But a bishop named Orlo in charge of[N]
the mines in the north may know.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Very well.[N]
Then we head north.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Galle...[N]
I'm sorry.[AN]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter[N]
of Princess Guinivere a secret,[AN]
so only I was assigned to search[N]
for her.[AN]
I'm sorry to get you mixed[N]
up in this...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry yourself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But you work directly under General[N]
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]General Murdock agreed to allow[N]
me to assist you.[AN]
He thinks it's vital we find the[N]
princess and the Fire Emblem.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think Princess[N]
Guinivere has the Fire Emblem?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's what His Majesty[N]
the king thinks.[AN]
And I think he's correct,[N]
all things considered.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Come now,[N]
don't be like that...[AN]
I'm sure Princess Guinivere[N]
went with good intentions.[AN]
Let's hurry now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]You're right...[AN][X]

you should leave here.[AN]
The village is in danger.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...No,[N]
I will stay.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have a younger brother, but he left[N]
with his friend next door to find work.[AN]
I'm taking care of his friend's[N]
sister. I can't abandon her.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I understand...[AN]
The most I can do to protect[N]
this village is leave.[AN]
I thank you again for[N]
tending to my wounds.[AN]
Please take care.[AN]

## Ch10B_ZinqueComplainsAndSendsBandits
[OpenMidRight][LoadZinque][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is going on out there?[AN]
Why is it taking so long to find a[N]
single member of the resistance?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the Lycian Army![AN]
They've joined the battle on[N]
behalf of the villagers...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Lycian Army?[N]
They would betray Etruria?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Also, milord, we have received[N]
a missive from Juteaux.[AN]
The Lycian Army is suspected[N]
of working with the bandits.[AN]
Lord Arcardo has given us orders[N]
to take them dead or alive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Lycian Army has ties with bandits?[N]
Hah! The irony![AN]
That fool only wants to save face...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, milord?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]This is not the mainland.[N]
The Isles are ruled by might.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not quite sure[N]
I understand...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Pay it no mind.[AN]
Was that all the message[N]
from Juteaux said?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There's more.[AN]
Lord Arcardo has provided[N]
us with reinforcements.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They should arrive soon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Confound it![AN]
We won't get credit for defeating Lycia[N]
if we're aided by reinforcements![AN]
We must wrap this up before they[N]
can join the fight...[AN]
Ah, I've an idea![N]
Get me Scollan![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[AN][ClearFace][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadScollan]You called,[N]
Lord Zinque?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Burn down the village.[N]
Kill any who resist.[AN]
[OpenLeft]...Can we take[N]
the loot?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do as you wish.[N]
Just do it quickly.[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You can count on us, Lord Zinque.[N]
Heh heh heh...[AN][X]

[OpenMidRight]There's a village to the south.[N]
With me so far?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]With you so far.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good. It might be a base[N]
for the resistance.[AN]
Zinque says to burn it to the[N]
ground, village and all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good, you understand.[N]
Now get goin'![AN]
Don't screw this one up,[N]

[OpenMidLeft]N-no...[AN][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Heh, he's ugly as sin,[N]
but he's got a heart of gold.[AN]
There's nothin' wrong with[N]
tearin' down a few houses.[AN][Clear]
Are we clear, wretches?[N]
No questions?[AN]

Juteaux should arrive shortly.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Blast![AN]

The last thing I need is[N]
reinforcements stealing the credit![AN][X]

[ToggleSmile]I hate the resistance![AN]
We civilians have to deal with the[N]
consequences of their actions.[AN]
You know we stand no chance if[N]
we try to stand up to our lord.[AN]
We just want to lead a normal life.[AN][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...I'm sorry.[N]
I'm just frustrated.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager42]A few months ago, my[N]

She was with a hulking monster of a man, so[N]
we threw stones at him to drive him off...[AN]
Afterwards my granddaughter told me that[N]
he was the one who led her to the village.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I am pleased to meet you.[N]
My name is Elffin.[AN]
I am a member of the[N]

[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the[N]
Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You have my thanks for[N]
saving the village here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We simply did what[N]
we believe is right.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you stand[N]
against Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Even so, I have[N]
no regrets.[AN]
We may have opposed Etruria's[N]
immediate interests,[AN]
but once the truth about the Isles is[N]
out, I'm certain they will understand.[AN]
I sent a letter to a trustworthy[N]
Etrurian noble.[AN]
If she takes appropriate measures,[N]
they will send us aid.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not[N]
be so sure...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why is that?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't you find it odd that Etruria[N]
requested your help here at all?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...yes, I do.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]If I may be so bold as to guess...[AN]
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and[N]
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...It was.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]There may have been ulterior motives for[N]
sending your army away.[AN]
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was[N]
undesirable to them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I never even[N]
considered that...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]There are rumors...that Roartz and[N]
Arcardo are working with Bern.[AN][X]
