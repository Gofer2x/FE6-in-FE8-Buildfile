## Ch2_Start1
[OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft][LoadRuud][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All I want to know is what[N]
happened to Princess Guinivere![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-yes, Captain Melady...[AN]
I'm certain she was in her room this[N]
morning, but she simply vanished...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]You told me that already, you buffoon![AN]
I don't want excuses! Are you so[N]
incompetent you can't understand that?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Well... I... Er...[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Our forces are mobilizing to[N]
begin a full-scale war with Lycia.[AN]
How are we to focus on the battle[N]
if the princess is missing?![AN]
Naturally, you will take full[N]
responsibility for her disappearance.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I never should have let Her Highness[N]
come to the border to begin with.[AN]
I will return to Bern and inform[N]
the king of this matter.[AN]
I'll try not to cause a panic, but I can't[N]
promise your life if the princess isn't found.[AN]
I trust you'll take every measure to[N]
locate her as soon as possible.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Captain![AN][X]





## Ch2_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRuud][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Is Princess Guinivere[N]
secure?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Commander. She's under constant[N]
surveillance in the cellar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good.[N]
Don't let her escape.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But Commander...[AN]
Are you sure this[N]
is a good idea?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Of course I'm sure![AN]
The younger sister of King Zephiel...[AN]
We're sure to get a hefty sum turning[N]
her over to one of Bern's enemies.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Loyalty to one's king.[N]
Bah. What a worthless notion.[AN]
The world is ruled by neither king[N]
nor queen. It's ruled by gold![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indubitably, Commander.[AN]
...But there has been a[N]
snag, shall we say.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?[N]
What do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I just received a report...[AN]
It seems that Princess Guinivere's[N]
lady-in-waiting has escaped...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?! You lout, why didn't[N]
you say so earlier?[AN][Clear]
Find her this instant![N]
Don't let her get away![AN][X]





## Ch2_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,[N]
this is the location.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]This is where we're supposed[N]
to meet the mercenaries?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, though it seems[N]
they aren't here yet.[AN]
[Clear]Wait, who's that? Somebody's[N]
coming this way...[AN][X]





## Ch2_Start4
[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
Be careful there![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, forgive me![N]
I'm in such a hurry...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No need for apologies.[AN]
Are you hurt?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.[N]
Thank you, good sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Farewell, then.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you from Lycia,[N]
by chance?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am.[AN]
I am the son of[N]
Marquess Pherae.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Saint Elimine! Thank you[N]
for guiding me to this boy![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pardon?[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Please, I need your help[N]
to rescue my mistress.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened?[AN]
[OpenRight]My name is Elen. I am a[N]
cleric of Saint Elimine.[AN]
My mistress and I came from Bern to seek[N]
an audience with the lords of Lycia.[AN]
However, Commander Ruud of the[N]
castle east of here trapped us.[AN]
We were captured, imprisoned[N]
by our own countrymen.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]
Lord Roy![AN]
We must avoid unnecessary[N]
entanglements with Bern![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But we can't neglect a noble of Bern who[N]
wants to speak with the lords of Lycia.[AN]
...Then again, we can't simply charge[N]
into enemy territory either...[AN][Clear]
Wait, who's there?![AN][X]





## Ch2_Start5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[ToggleSmile]There she is![AN]
Over here, boys![N]
Get the girl![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Our orders say[N]
dead or alive![AN][X]





## Ch2_Start6
[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][ToggleSmile]Oh dear...[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
Well, Merlinus, they provoked hostilities.[N]
I don't think we have any choice now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You wouldn't listen even[N]
if we did, I'm sure.[AN]
But no matter. Let me witness all you've[N]
learned about tactics in Ostia.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]All right, everyone![N]
We're going to charge the castle![AN]
Sister Elen, you should[N]
find a place to hide...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElen]No, I will[N]
come with you.[AN]
I cannot fight, but I can[N]
heal wounded allies.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm the one that got you[N]
tangled up in this mess.[AN]
Please let me do what I can to help.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]OK, but just stay behind[N]
us so you aren't hurt.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Certainly. Thank you[N]
for the concern.[AN][X]




## Ch2_MercsAppear1
[OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][ToggleSmile]They should be around[N]
here somewhere...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Shanna, [OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]check around and try to[N]
find the soldiers from Pherae, will you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure![AN][X]





## Ch2_MercsAppear2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So Big Man, who's our[N]
client this time?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]House Pherae, one of the[N]
noble families of Lycia.[AN]
The marquess's son is going to join the[N]
other armies of the Lycian League.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][ToggleSmile]We're going up[N]
against Bern then?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Looks that way.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][FastPrint]Finally, a foe worthy of my axe![N]
Let's show 'em what we're made of![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][ToggleSmile]Bern, eh? This won't be easy, I can[N]
tell you that. We had best tread lightly.[AN][X]





## Ch2_MercsAppear3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I think I've found them![AN]
[ToggleSmile]But it looks like they're already[N]
caught up in a skirmish.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What? The fighting's[N]
started already?[AN]
Let's get a move on then.[N]
Time to earn our pay![AN][X]





## Ch2_RoyDieckTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you Lord Roy of[N]
House Pherae?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who is it that's asking?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Name's Dieck.[AN]
You should've heard about me from[N]
an older man named Merlinus.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So you're the leader of[N]
the mercenary band?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Just a small company, really.[AN]
Sorry we're late.[AN]
Didn't think the fighting[N]
would start so soon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well... There was[N]
a complication...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Don't take it the wrong way.[N]
We don't blame you.[AN]
Actually, quite the contrary.[AN]
My boys are excited for a chance[N]
to show off their skills.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Brilliant. It sounds like you're just[N]
the caliber of fighters we need.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Enough chitchat then.[AN]
Let's wrap things up.[AN][X]





## Ch2_ArmorslayerVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager7]Armored knights have nearly[N]
impenetrable defenses.[AN]
But some weapons, like this sword,[N]
can pierce their armor.[AN]
I'm sure you can get better use out[N]
of it than us. Please, take it.[AN][X]





## Ch2_FliersHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager12]Pegasi are useful for flying to[N]
hard-to-reach places.[AN]
But woe to any rider who finds[N]
herself against an archer.[AN]
An arrow can make short work[N]
of a pegasus![AN][X]



## Ch2_FortsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]Forts are the key to a good defense.[AN]
If you're in a fort, you can defend[N]
and even dodge more easily.[AN]
On top of that, your wounds[N]
will heal slowly over time.[AN][X]



## Ch2_WeaponTriangleHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager8]The weapon triangle...[N]
Swords, axes, and lances.[AN]
Remember, swords best axes, axes best[N]
lances, and lances best swords.[AN]
Keep this in mind and things[N]
will be much easier for you.[AN][X]





## Ch2_End1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![AN]
There was a woman locked[N]
in the cellar![AN]
[OpenRight]That must be Elen's mistress.[N]
Bring her here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[ToggleSmile][AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][X]





## Ch2_End2IfElen
[OpenFarRight][LoadElen]Your Highness![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen![N]
I'm so relieved you're well.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]You put yourself in such danger[N]
running off like you did...[AN]
I worried myself sick about you.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I am sorry, Your Highness, but I couldn't[N]
leave you in that dank cellar...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry yourself, Elen.[N]
It's thanks to you I am safe now.[AN][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][X]


## Ch2_End3
[OpenMidLeft]I am in your debt.[N]
May I ask your name...?[AN]
[OpenRight]I am Roy, son of Eliwood,[N]
Marquess Pherae.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure...[N]
As for myself...[AN][X]





## Ch2_End4IfElen
[OpenFarRight][LoadElen][ToggleSmile]Your Highness... Are you[N]
certain you should?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Elen. It is fine.[AN][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][X]





## Ch2_End5
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My name is[N]
Guinivere.[AN]
[OpenRight]Guinivere?![AN]
That's the name of the[N]
princess of Bern![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is I.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]What?![AN]
This was a trap,[N]
wasn't it?![AN]
[OpenRight]Merlinus, hold.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]I beg your pardon,[N]
Lord Roy, but...[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I wish to hear her out.[N]
Give her a chance, will you?[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tsk. As you will...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]You are truly Princess[N]
Guinivere from Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, truly. I cannot blame you[N]
for doubting me, however.[AN]
[OpenRight]Maybe you are the princess of Bern,[N]
and maybe you aren't.[AN]
I can see from your actions and dress[N]
that you are at least of high status.[AN]
If you are indeed Princess Guinivere, however,[N]
there's one thing I don't understand.[AN]
Elen told me you intended to meet[N]
the lords of the Lycian League.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is correct.[AN]
[OpenRight]Why, if you are the sister[N]
of the king of Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to find a peaceful[N]
way to end the war.[AN]
If I can speak to the Lycian council, I'm[N]
certain we can come to a solution.[AN]
[OpenRight]Your brother instigated this war.[N]
Is it in your power to stop it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]At the very least, I wish to do everything[N]
I can. No, I MUST do everything I can.[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]...I see.[AN]
For the time being, come with us to[N]
meet the Lycian League armies.[AN]
I want to see what Lord Hector[N]
thinks of this affair.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You will allow me[N]
to accompany you?[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. If there is any possibility to[N]
avoid further bloodshed, we must try.[AN]
It matters not how small the chance.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you![AN]
I truly am in your debt...[AN][X]
