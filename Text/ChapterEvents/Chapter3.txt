## Ch3_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][FastPrint][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty, we have[N]
captured the enemy commander.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.[N]
Bring him before me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadHectorBlood]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]You...[AN]
You're Zephiel, the king of Bern!![AN]
Black-hearted fiend...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ah, Lord Hector.[AN]
You have my highest praise for lasting so[N]
long against two of my Wyvern Generals.[AN]
I suppose Ostia's reputation as the most[N]
powerful house in Lycia is well-earned.[AN]
The strongest of a bucket of worms is[N]
hardly a match for my boot, however.[AN]
Your end is nigh. If you've any last[N]
words, I suggest you spit them out.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Just tell me...[N]
Why...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What was that?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Bern and Lycia...[AN]
We were always on good terms with[N]
each other...[AN]
Even when you took the throne, we[N]
always paid our respects to Bern...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Respect?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Pah. Don't make me laugh.[AN]
The whole continent shall be my domain.[N]
Only then can the world be liberated.[AN]
I lack the time to concern myself with[N]
such trivial matters as "respect."[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You mean to liberate...the world?[AN]
What do you speak of...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Pay it no heed. You won't[N]
live to see it anyway.[AN]
You there![AN]
Take him away![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Throw this dead man[N]
into the dungeon![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, Your Majesty![AN][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya][CloseSpeechFast]Your Majesty, I will take my leave now.[N]
I must return to the plains of Sacae.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, be on your way.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...One matter before I leave, Your Majesty.[AN]
If you will allow my opinion, I would not[N]
place so much trust in that...woman.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Do you speak of Idunn?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, Your Majesty.[AN]
The men call her the "Dark Priestess"[N]
and find her presence disturbing.[AN]
I understand that she is a shaman[N]
of great power, but--[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brunnya,[N]
do you doubt my judgment?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Ah...! No, of course[N]
not, Your Majesty![AN]
I just think--[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Your duty is not to think.[AN]
Your duty is to follow orders.[AN]
Is that clear?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, Your Majesty.[N]
Your will shall be done.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
"Do you doubt my judgment?"[AN]
Dear me, the words that come[N]
out of my mouth sometimes...[AN][X]





## Ch3_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector[N]
still lives?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, probably.[AN]
I saw some of Bern's soldiers[N]
take him into the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, was it? Do you know the[N]
inside of Castle Araphen well?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess so.[AN]
...Wait, are you guys going to[N]
try to save Lord Hector?[AN]
Sounds like a bad idea to me.[AN]
Most of Bern's forces are gone, but there[N]
are still plenty of soldiers in the castle.[AN]
Marching in would be suicide.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps.[AN]
But you said most of their[N]
army is already gone.[AN]
We can't afford to lose[N]
Lord Hector.[AN]
If we have a chance, we[N]
must take it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really, now...?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'll come with you then.[AN]
I can show you around[N]
the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[N]
You don't have to do that.[AN]
Please, just explain what the[N]
interior of the castle is like.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I've got a bone to pick with Bern.[N]
Please, let me go with you![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]If you insist, we're happy to[N]
have you.[AN]
I think your skills will be an asset.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I can pick any[N]
locked doors or chests![AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Lord Roy...[AN]
I'm sorry for my brother...[AN]
I didn't think the invasion[N]
would pick up so quickly...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Princess, you're not[N]
responsible for this.[AN]
Please don't blame yourself.[N]
Besides, Lycia is still united.[AN]
We just need Lord Hector to lead[N]
our army so we can fight![AN][Clear]
We must retake Castle Araphen for all[N]
of Lycia...and for Lilina...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight]Let's move out![AN][X]





## Ch3_LughBishopCutscene
[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][LoadPriest][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thanks for taking the children[N]
under your care, Bishop.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[AN]
The St. Elimine Church will take[N]
good care of the orphans.[AN]
And what will you do, Lugh?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm going to stay here.[N]
I have some things to take care of.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is that so...?[N]
Please be safe.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadVillager14][OpenFarLeft][LoadVillager13][OpenMidRight]Make sure you listen to what[N]
the priest says, OK?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]You're not coming[N]
with us, Lugh?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm going to wait for Chad.[N]
We'll catch up with you later...[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yay![N]
Chad's coming too?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Of course.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I want Raigh[N]
back too![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes...[AN]
If Raigh would come back we could[N]
all be together again.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadPriest][CloseSpeechFast]Children,[N]
we must be off.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenFarLeft]See you,[N]
Lugh.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Don't take too long.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, yes. Hurry along now...[AN][Clear]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry for lying...[AN]
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.[AN][X]







## Ch3_ThroneRoom1
[OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Narcian![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenMidRight]What is causing all that noise?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's left of the enemy are likely[N]
putting up one last fight.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Shall I summon the dragons,[N]
Your Highness?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNarcian][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No need, my lady. We can handle them[N]
without so much as breaking a sweat.[AN][OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Not now, Idunn.[AN]
Send the dragons back to[N]
Bern as planned.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, Your Highness.[N]
As you will.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNarcian][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I too must return [N]
to Bern.[AN]
Narcian, I leave Lycia in[N]
your hands.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What shall I do with the remnants[N]
of the Lycian Army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Kill all who stand[N]
against you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What of women[N]
and children?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Was I unclear? Kill all who[N]
stand against you.[AN]
Grind them to dust.[AN]
Ensure no others dare dream[N]
of opposing us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, Your Majesty.[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[AN][X]





## Ch3_ThroneRoom2
[OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][OpenMidLeft][LoadSlater][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, what does His Majesty[N]
see in that Idunn anyway?[AN]
Well, I think it's time I[N]
left as well.[AN]
Slater, I entrust the[N]
castle to you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Might I inquire where[N]
you're going, milord?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A marquess who turned against Lycia[N]
has a special gift for me.[AN]
He says it's a girl of Etrurian[N]
nobility...[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Etrurian nobility?[N]
She must be quite a catch![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, the marquess tells me she's[N]
a beautiful thing.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You must be looking forward[N]
to it.[AN]
Please be careful on your[N]
way there.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You be careful too, Slater. Don't let[N]
these scattered remnants defeat you.[AN]
Should you fail, I personally will[N]
order your public evisceration.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Have mercy...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha...![AN][X]

Lugh, you're not thinking of...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I can use some magic![AN]
Remember I borrowed that fire[N]
tome from Poppa's room?[AN]

incapable of harming others.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Poppa.[N]
You stay with the others, Lugh.[AN]

Poppa, you, and even Raigh...[AN]

You're with the Lycian Army, right?[AN]
Please, let me fight with you![AN]
I don't have any useful information,[N]

I'm sure I can help you![AN][X]

## Ch3_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![AN]
We found Lord Hector[N]
in the dungeon![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]You did?![N]
Is he all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]He's gravely wounded...[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHectorBlood][NormalPrint]Well met, Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]Lord Hector![AN]
That gaping wound...![AN]
We must get you help![N]
Here, lean on my shoulder...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry yourself...[N]
I'm done for...[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]We were taken by surprise...[AN]
We'd have never supposed that Bern[N]
had summoned dragons...![AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Dragons?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[AN]
The same dragons that humans fought[N]
against in the Scouring...[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The Scouring?[N]
I learned of that in my studies.[AN]
Eons ago, dragon and human each had[N]
dominion of half of Elibe.[AN]
The Scouring was a war for total[N]
control of the continent...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Very good, lad...[AN]
The Eight Legends...defeated the dragons[N]
and led the humans to...victory...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How did Bern summon dragons...?[AN][OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I...haven't the faintest...[AN]
But...Bern was once the[N]
dragons' domain...[AN]
Hartmut, one of the Eight Legends...[N]
was the founder of Bern...[AN]
Perhaps...the reason...lies[N]
there...[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Roy... Go to Ostia...[AN]
You must...lead what remains of[N]
the Lycian Army...in my place...[AN]
[OpenRight]Me...? But...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Fear not...in Ostia...is a weapon...[N]
that...can take down a dragon...[AN]
[OpenRight]A weapon?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina can tell you more...[N]
Please take care of her...[AN]
She...may act strong...[N]
But she is still a child...[AN]
Please...don't let...her...d...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...I promise you,[N]
I won't.[AN]
