## Ch4_Start
[OpenMidLeft][LoadErik][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][OpenMidLeft]Ah, welcome,[N]
General Narcian.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Erik.[AN]
I don't think I've yet praised your[N]
wisdom in joining Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you. My nation has never been[N]
anything but a burden to me anyway.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You, my friend, are wise[N]
beyond your years.[AN]
Now, where is that gift[N]
you promised me?[AN]
She does not seem to be here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes![N]
She is in her quarters.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]She is exceedingly naive, you see.[AN]
When I told her she could meet her brother,[N]
she cooperated without question.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]You there![N]
Bring her here![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenFarLeft][LoadClarine]What is this hall?[N]
Klein? Where are you, Brother?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Welcome, Lady Clarine.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Who might you be?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Narcian, one of Bern's[N]
three Wyvern Generals.[AN]
My lovely little lass, I think you will enjoy[N]
my company more than your brother's...[AN]
[MoveRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Heh...
Ha ha ha![AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What?[AN]
Why do you laugh?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You compare yourself to my brother?[AN]
You think too highly of yourself.[AN]
Your garb, your hair--even your speech...[AN]
All a painfully obvious guise to hide[N]
your true lowborn face.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lowborn?! Me?![N]
You would compare ME to a peasant?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, heavens no.[AN]
I would sooner compare you to a[N]
filthy, disease-ridden mutt![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Y-you vermin!![AN]
I'll see you[N]
suffer![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadSoldier2]General Narcian, we just received word that[N]
Castle Araphen was retaken by the enemy![AN]
[OpenRight]What?! Impossible![N]
What of Slater?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Err...[N]
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.[AN]
The enemy is reported to be Roy,[N]
son of Marquess Pherae.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadClarine][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Accursed interruptions![AN]
Lord Erik, lock the girl in a cell.[AN]
I will give her the pleasure of[N]
my company when I return![AN]
You, blockade the highroad[N]
from Ostia.[AN]
This Roy might just pass by.[N]
I want his head![AN]
[OpenLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, sir![AN][X]





## Ch4_PiratesAppear
[OpenMidRight][LoadScollan][NormalPrint]Heh... Foolish nobility. Always[N]
involved in some petty dispute.[AN]
'Course, you'll hear no complaints from us.[N]
Turmoil's how we make a living.[AN]
Heh heh heh...[AN][X]





## Ch4_RutgerClarine1
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]They will pay dearly[N]
for this treatment...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Hey.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Who's there?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][CloseSpeechFast]I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Erik.[AN]
He wants to see you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]I will not.[AN]
I refuse to meet with[N]
such churlish people.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Just get over here.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Let go! You will regret this![N]
Have you any idea who I am?![AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Let go, I say![AN][X]





## Ch4_RutgerClarine2
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Let go![N]
Let go, I say![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Keep it down.[AN]
You won't be able to make a clean[N]
escape making all that noise.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Escape?![.....]
Then you're...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I prepared a horse for you[N]
out back under a tree.[AN]
Take it and go, while[N]
everyone's distracted.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Why are you helping me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I despise Bern with[N]
all my soul.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]With all your soul?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Never mind.[N]
Forget it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]
Saying that only piques[N]
my curiosity further.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Time is short.[N]
Hurry![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]





## Ch4_RutgerClarine3
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][ToggleSmile]I've never met such a boorish man![N]
This is a battlefield![AN]
A proper gentleman would escort[N]
a lady to her mansion![AN]
Well, it's hardly of concern now.[AN]
Sigh, I only came here to see my brother,[N]
and now look at the mess I'm in...[AN]
What am I to do now?[AN][X]





## Ch4_RutgerWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadErik][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah,[N]
there you are![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We need some backup.[AN]
Take some troops and[N]
prepare for battle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you deaf?[N]
Go and fight![AN]
[OpenMidRight]I heard you.[N]
I'll leave when I'm ready.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Tsk. Not the amiable sort, is he?[AN]
If his sword arm is as skilled as the rumors[N]
say, though, then it's no matter.[AN][X]





## Ch4_RutgerAppears
[LoadRutger][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]





## Ch4_ClarineRecruitsHerself
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarine][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Pardon me,[N]
you there![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]Me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you see anyone else?[AN]
You are the leader of this[N]
little group, are you not?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I am.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Most convenient.[AN]
Very well then. You[N]
will protect me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Excuse me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hard of hearing?[AN]
I said that you will[N]
protect me from harm.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]Mind your mouth,[N]
young lady![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Away with you, peasant.[N]
I was not addressing you.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?![N]
Who do you think--[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint]Calm yourself, Merlinus...[AN]
It looks like she's being pursued[N]
by the castle's soldiers.[AN]
That's why she wants us to[N]
guard her.[AN]
Right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, yes![AN]
That is correct...[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMerlinus]
Im...impudent child![AN]
We can't simply accept any[N]
useless girl into our army![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]You may call me[N]
Lady Clarine, peasant.[AN]
And I am not useless![AN]
I can use staves to heal[N]
wounded allies.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint]So you'll help us fight?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...If that's what it takes![AN]
I suppose I can't simply demand protection[N]
without any kind of payment.[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, we appreciate it![AN]
Our enemy is Bern, so we need[N]
everyone we can get.[AN]
I'm Roy.[N]
Pleased to meet you, Lady Clarine.[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]The pleasure is all--[AN]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ahem! Let's focus on[N]
the issue at hand.[AN][X]





## Ch4_ClarineRecruitsRutger
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh![N]
It's you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[N]
You're still here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]"Still here?"[AN]
You abandoned me in the middle[N]
of a battlefield![AN]
How can you have the[N]
nerve to say that?![AN]
I could have been killed![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess you're lucky[N]
you're still alive then.[AN]
Did you want something or[N]
can I go now?[AN]
[OpenRight]Just a moment![AN]
I shan't allow you to abandon[N]
me twice.[AN]
A gentleman must take[N]
responsibility for his actions.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Responsibility? For what? I saved[N]
you from that twisted sadist.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]If a gentleman rescues a lady, he must[N]
also escort her to her mansion![AN]
In what fairy tale does some barf[N]
of a man abandon his princess?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What in the world[N]
are you on about?[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Besides, you said you "despise[N]
Bern with all your soul."[AN]
If you ask me, you'd be better off joining[N]
us. We'll be fighting Bern, you know.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What? Wait![N]
Is that true?[AN]
Is that army you're in really[N]
going to challenge Bern?[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Yes... Our leader, Floyd or whatever[N]
his name is, told me so himself.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Fine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I'll join your army.[N]
Satisfied?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ah...I suppose.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Wait![AN]
My protection is more important[N]
than fighting Bern! Come back![AN][X]





## Ch4_DoorKeyVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager13]
Without a thief, you can't open[N]
doors and chests so easily.[AN]
Only thieves can use lockpicks.[AN]
But I have something called a door[N]
key, which will open any door.[AN]
Anyone can use it.[N]
You can have it.[AN][X]





## Ch4_SteelBladeVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4][ToggleSmile]We're all on your side.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We're not about to abandon the[N]
land in which we were born.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Please take this sword.[AN]
It was given to us generations ago.[N]
A gift from the marquess.[AN][X]





## Ch4_AngelicRobeVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe this war is happening...[AN]
We'll all suffer under Bern's[N]
iron-fisted rule.[AN]
But you just might be able[N]
to stop them.[AN]
Here is something that will help[N]
you fight a little longer.[AN]
Think carefully before using it.[AN][X]





## Ch4_BanditWarningHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]Bandits and pirates will[N]
attack nearby towns.[AN]
Once they loot a town,[N]
there's nothing left.[AN]
Visit the towns quickly and they[N]
might just share something good![AN][X]





## Ch4_LausNomadsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager11]There are mounted soldiers[N]
with bows in Laus' army.[AN]
They're from the nomad clans[N]
of Sacae.[AN]
Everyone wants their fighting[N]
prowess these days...[AN][X]




## Ch4_ReaverHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager8]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You know the weapon triangle, but did you[N]
know it doesn't apply to all weapons?[AN]
Some weapons completely reverse[N]
the weapon triangle.[AN]
For instance, you might find an axe that[N]
will work well against swords.[AN][X]





## Ch4_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy! The remaining[N]
soldiers from Laus are retreating.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[N]
Tell everyone to get some rest.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][.....][LoadGuinivere]Roy...[N]
Are you all right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I never would have thought that[N]
Lord Erik would turn on Lycia.[AN]
I thought the Lycian League's[N]
bond was stronger than this.[AN]
Cowardly Bern![N]
Underhanded tactics![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I apologize.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I'm sorry.[AN]
I wasn't even thinking[N]
about you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No... You are right.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We'll now proceed west towards Ostia.[AN]
But now we know that even the other[N]
marquesses can't be trusted.[AN]
With Lord Hector gone, I fear there[N]
may be no peaceful end for this war.[AN]
Princess, do you plan on returning[N]
to Bern? If you need anything--[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, please allow me to stay,[N]
if it would not be a burden.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You, a burden? Never![N]
But why do you wish to stay?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My brother is wrong.[AN]
He is pulling the dragons[N]
into a human war.[AN]
If he thinks this is how he can[N]
free the world, I must stop him.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Free the world?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, he has always been obsessed[N]
with "liberating the world."[AN]
He said that's the purpose[N]
of this war.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know...[AN]
My brother is not so power-hungry that[N]
he would attempt to conquer the world.[AN]
I'm sure he believes strongly in[N]
what he's done to Elibe.[AN]
Regardless, that doesn't excuse[N]
the violence he has caused...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere...[AN][X]
