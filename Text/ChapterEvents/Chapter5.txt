## Ch5_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadDory][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Boss![AN]
Our boys just got back from[N]
scouting the village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then let's go get[N]
our tribute.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But Boss, something's[N]
different today.[AN]
There's an army stationed[N]
real close to us![AN]
They say it looks like[N]
the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lycia? Then there's[N]
nothing to worry about.[AN]
They were almost wiped[N]
out by Bern.[AN]
We can handle a few[N]
battered soldiers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right, Boss![AN]
[OpenMidRight]They've probably got some[N]
valuables on them too![AN]
Still, don't get careless.[AN][Clear]
Ready then? Let's mop up[N]
these losers, boys![AN][X]





## Ch5_Start2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]A villager is here to see you,[N]
Lord Roy.[AN]
Hey, you, wait just a second...[AN][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadVillager2][FastPrint]Are you Lord Roy of[N]
House Pherae?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.[N]
How may I help you?[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Milord, I beg you![AN]
Please, rid us of the bandits[N]
terrorizing our village![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Bandits?[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]There's a group of bandits that made their[N]
base in the castle near the cliffs.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Where are the castle guards?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]They fled once they heard that the[N]
Lycian Army was defeated by Bern...[AN]
We villagers were left on our own.[AN]
Our days are spent in fear of[N]
bandit attacks.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenLeft]We have no one else we can ask.[N]
Please, help us![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][SendToBack][NormalPrint]Lord Roy, we must keep[N]
our pace towards Ostia...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.[AN]
But we can't simply ignore[N]
people in need of help![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You're joking![AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You will help us?![N]
Thank you![AN]
Please use the gate[N]
to the west.[AN]
It'll take you right[N]
to the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[AN]
[OpenLeft]I'll arrange for the gate to be[N]
opened when you approach.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Merlinus! We're going to the[N]
castle to drive off the bandits![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Sigh... Youthful energy.[N]
Where does it come from?[AN][X]




## Ch5_DorothySaulYoderCutscene
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Dorothy. Please tell[N]
Brother Saul as well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I will, Father Yoder.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But where did Saul run off to now?[AN]
How am I supposed to guard him[N]
if he keeps disappearing?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadVillager5][OpenRight][LoadSaul][OpenLeft][FastPrint]Er... Brother Saul, I appreciate[N]
the offer, but not tonight...[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Come now, don't be like that.[AN]
We can sit by the fire in the dark of night[N]
as I soothe you with my calming sermons...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDorothy][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]There you are![N]
Saul![AN]
[OpenRight]Wonderful.[N]
Dorothy...[AN]
[OpenLeft][SendToBack]I'll take my leave now.[AN][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]No, don't go![AN][Clear]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh my... Look what you've[N]
done now, Dorothy.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]That expression on your face[N]
scared her away.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is my normal look![AN]
Saul, you can't try to woo[N]
every girl you meet.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You make it sound like a bad thing![AN]
I simply offer my helping hand[N]
to any poor souls in need.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why do you always offer[N]
to give your sermons at night?[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Well, putting that aside...[AN]
Did you have some reason for[N]
interrupting my good work?[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.[AN]
The Lycian Army is apparently[N]
somewhere around here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Truly?! Is Princess Guinivere[N]
still with them?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes, if the reports from the[N]
St. Elimine Church are accurate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must make haste![N]
Let us join them.[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What's the matter,[N]
Dorothy?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You only want to join them because Princess[N]
Guinivere is said to be so beautiful.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous...[N]
Come now, hurry along.[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, let's go![AN][X]





## Ch5_GateOpens
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]Oh, I heard you were coming.[N]
I'll open the gate now.[AN][X]





## Ch5_BossAngryAtGate
[OpenMidRight][LoadDory][ToggleSmile]What?[N]
There was a gate there?[AN]
Cunning little[N]
weaklings...[AN][X]





## Ch5_GantsLanceVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager7]
[OpenMidRight]Hold on. Before you go,[N]
take this lance with you.[AN]
It was once wielded by a[N]
knight called Sir Gant.[AN]
The stories say he bested many[N]
a foe with this lance![AN][X]





## Ch5_FortsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager8]
If you can, try to occupy forts![AN]
That'll stop enemy reinforcements[N]
from showing up![AN][X]





## Ch5_AraphenDragonHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager12]
[OpenMidRight]I was there when[N]
Araphen was taken...[AN]
The wyvern riders of Bern were[N]
terrifying enough...[AN]
But then a dragon engulfed the[N]
Lycian Army in flame...[AN]
Oh Elimine, please tell me[N]
it was a dream...[AN][X]






## Ch5_BrigandsMountainsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This whole area is really perfect for[N]
bandits. It's no wonder they appeared.[AN]
They can cross mountains and a bandit on[N]
a peak is a force to be reckoned with.[AN]
Dreadful. Just dreadful...[AN][X]





## Ch5_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenFarRight][LoadGuinivere][OpenRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![AN]
A priest from the St. Elimine Church[N]
wants an audience with you...[AN]
and Princess Guinivere![AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]He knew that Princess Guinivere[N]
was with us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes. I can't imagine how.[AN]
[OpenRight]Me neither...[AN]
I'll see him alone.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy, I will be fine.[N]
I wish to meet this priest.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Princess?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tensions between my brother and the[N]
church have worsened as of late.[AN]
I do not believe that they would[N]
attempt anything underhanded.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I see. Merlinus, allow[N]
this priest in.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, it is a pleasure to meet[N]
you at last.[AN]
I am Saul, an acolyte of the[N]
St. Elimine Church.[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Pleased to meet you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]And you must be Princess Guinivere![AN]
You are as beautiful as[N]
the rumors say![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Pardon me...?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ahem... Forgive me.[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
Your Highness, I wish to know the[N]
location of the Fire Emblem.[AN]
You have it with you,[N]
do you not?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]
[ToggleSmile]How did you know that?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern's head church tells us the Fire Emblem[N]
disappeared from the Shrine of Seals.[AN]
And you also went missing at exactly the[N]
same time.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was sent by the church to[N]
confirm the truth.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Why did you take the Fire Emblem?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...I wished to stop my brother.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Your brother...[N]
Zephiel, the king of Bern.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you know what the[N]
Fire Emblem is used for?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...It's the key that awakens a sword that[N]
was used to slay the dragons long ago.[AN]
That was what my father told me anyway.[AN]
I am unsure how exactly the Fire[N]
Emblem or the sword work.[AN]
My brother seemed to worry about the[N]
Fire Emblem falling into enemy hands.[AN]
...Extraordinarily so.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you took the Fire Emblem to make the king[N]
believe it fell into enemy hands?[AN]
All in an attempt to stop his conquest?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Yes...but the war continued anyway.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And what will you do now?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...Must I reveal my plan[N]
at this moment?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Yes. I have not given up hope of settling[N]
this war without further bloodshed.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I see.[AN]
In that case, I will accompany[N]
you on your journey.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]If Roy allows it.[AN]
[OpenRight]I have no objections.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere]Thank you, Roy.[AN]
[OpenRight]Of course, Princess.[AN][X]
