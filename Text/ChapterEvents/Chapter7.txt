## Ch7_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDebias][OpenMidRight][LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Is everything quiet,[A]
Debias?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, General. The townspeople are[A]
no trouble.[AN]
But the Ilian mercenaries that Hector[A]
hired still refuse to join us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What more do they want?[A]
We already said we'd pay more![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia's mercenary knights[A]
are famously loyal.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]I know that, you[A]
bloated imbecile![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][AN]
[OpenRight]But General Narcian[A]
will arrive soon![AN]
If we don't have Ostia under[A]
our control by then,[AN]
he'll never take us[A]
seriously![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Y-yes, General.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina may make for a valuable[A]
bargaining chip with the mercenaries...[AN]
If her life is in danger, they[A]
should surrender.[AN]
But that must be a last resort.[AN]
First we must attempt to beat them[A]
into submission.[AN]
The wyvern riders Bern sent us[A]
should prove invaluable![AN]
Debias, I want the mercenaries pacified[A]
and the castle gate secured.[AN]
I will be inside the castle readying[A]
our defenses.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, General![AN][X]

## Ch7_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]How many of Ostia's troops[A]
have joined the rebellion?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Quite a large majority,[A]
I'm afraid.[AN]
They've forgotten their fealty[A]
to Lord Hector.[AN]
They all simply gave in to[A]
Bern because they're afraid.[AN]
It's a disgrace, I tell you.[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Is that so...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But it's not all[A]
bad news, Lord Roy![AN]
There's a band of mercenaries from Ilia[A]
that wish to join us to stop the rebels.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadGuinivere]Mercenaries from[A]
Ilia, you say?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, yes.[AN]
They signed a contract with Lord Hector[A]
to fight Bern alongside Ostia.[AN]
[OpenRight]They could be a great help.[AN]
But do they know Lord Hector[A]
has passed away?[AN]
Isn't their contract void[A]
now that he's gone?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I would have thought[A]
so, too, Lord Roy.[AN]
They told me themselves however that they[A]
heard of Lord Hector's passing.[AN]
They're still eager to fight with us.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]They're only mercenaries.[A]
Why would they go so far?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia is a frozen land with a harsh[A]
climate so the land is very infertile.[AN]
And so, mercenary contracts are a major[A]
source of income in Ilia.[AN]
Ilian mercenaries are said to never[A]
betray their employers, no matter what.[AN]
It seems that's true indeed.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Then they should be[A]
powerful allies.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I agree! Fortune is[A]
still with us![AN][ToggleSmile]
But...the mercenary I spoke to[A]
also had some bad news.[AN]
He said one of the three Wyvern Generals is[A]
headed here with a legion of wyvern riders.[AN]
Should they aid the rebels, our chance of[A]
victory will be all but gone.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy... What are you going to do?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Kingdom of Etruria[A]
might help us.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Etruria?![A]
Is it possible?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]General Cecilia, Mage General of Etruria,[A]
was my teacher in tactics at Ostia.[AN]
I feel she may join forces with[A]
us if we ask.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I object, Lord Roy![AN]
If we have Etruria solve this Lycian matter,[A]
our reputation with them will never recover![AN]
[OpenRight]That may be so...[AN]
But this is a matter of life or death[A]
for Lycia.[AN]
We must ask for help, for if we don't, Lycia[A]
as we know it may become just a memory.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lord Roy.[AN]
[OpenRight]But we must act quickly! I've already[A]
penned a letter to General Cecilia.[AN]
Merlinus, I need you to send the[A]
letter to her right away.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, Lord Roy![A]
I trust your judgment.[AN]
I shall send it this[A]
instant.[AN]
[OpenRight]With any luck, she'll[A]
make it in time.[AN][Clear]
Get ready for combat, soldiers![A]
We will retake Ostia![AN][X]


## Ch7_ZelotAndTreckAppear
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It looks like the Lycian Army has[A]
commenced a counterattack on the rebels.[AN]
Let's join them and quell this[A]
shameful little rebellion![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Uh-huh.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Wait,[A]
where's Noah?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Uhhh, I think he went to the[A]
arena a little while ago.[AN]
He said he's coaching some[A]
girl in swordplay.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Noah, a coach?[A]
That's not like him...[AN]
Has he made a little girlfriend,[A]
I wonder? Ha ha.[AN]
Well, no matter.[A]
He can catch up with us later.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Uh-huh.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Time for action.[A]
Move out.[AN][X]

## Ch7_NoahAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.[AN]
I need to get going, Fir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for helping[A]
me, Sir Noah.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
I sure was surprised when you[A]
came up to me though.[AN]
Not many people would challenge someone[A]
to a match so quickly like that.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.[AN]
I'd never fought in[A]
the arena before...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you'd asked anyone else,[A]
you'd be dead now.[AN]
You need to look your opponent over[A]
carefully before choosing a fight.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And I must have the humility to surrender[A]
if it appears I'll lose.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Exactly.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]You can always get your money back,[A]
but don't throw your life away.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]You're right![A]
Thank you![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What will you do now?[AN]
Will you stay here and continue[A]
practicing the sword?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I'm going to the[A]
Western Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Western Isles?[A]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They're constructing a new mine, so there[A]
are many new workers headed there.[AN]
Miners are strong, so it's no doubt an ideal[A]
place to find new opponents to challenge.[AN]
And besides...[AN][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Western Isles is where my[A]
mother first met my father.[AN]
She's passed on, but at my age she traveled[A]
around the world training herself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]So that's it...[A]
You surprise me again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Why?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I thought all you wanted was[A]
to become strong.[AN]
I didn't realize you were following[A]
in your mother's footsteps.[AN]
You do have a cute side after all![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sir Noah![A]
Please don't tease me![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ha ha ha ha![AN][X]

## Ch7_DebiasTalksAboutReinforcements
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDebias][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The reinforcements should be[A]
arriving from the south soon.[AN]
Heh heh... I want to see the look on their[A]
faces when they get hit from behind![AN][X]

## Ch7_RoyRecruitsZelot
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][FastPrint][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, are you Sir Zelot of[A]
the Ilian mercenaries?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]That's me.[A]
And you are?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[AN]
I lead the army that's[A]
fighting the rebels.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...[A]
I expected someone older.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm here because Lord Hector[A]
asked me to be.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...[A]
We've lost a great man.[AN]
He was a true warrior.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We have to retake Ostia.[A]
For Lord Hector![AN]
And for Lilina...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I concur.[AN]
We'll offer what[A]
help we can.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for[A]
the assistance.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Save the thanks for after[A]
we've retaken the castle.[AN]
Come! We must concentrate[A]
on the enemy now![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Right![AN][X]

## Ch7_RoyRecruitsNoah
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you one of the[A]
Ilian mercenaries?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure am.[A]
Can I help you?[AN][A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I lead the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh! I heard about you...[AN]
I'm supposed to take orders[A]
from you now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure[A]
that's all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't you have to check in[A]
with your commander...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He told us we're joining the[A]
Lycian Army. That's enough for me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he mean like this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]This is a battlefield.[AN]
There's no time to check[A]
everything with the commander.[AN]
As long as I'm following orders, and[A]
I am, I can play it by ear.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see.[A]
Thanks for the help.[AN][X]

## Ch7_ZelotRecruitsNoah
[OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][NormalPrint]Noah![OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot.[A]
Sorry I'm late.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I heard you were coaching a[A]
girl in swordplay.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[AN]
She was inexperienced and naive,[A]
so I felt obligated.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]She isn't with you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She left. She said she was[A]
heading for the Western Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Pity. I thought she might have been of[A]
some help were she still here.[AN]
But you, a coach? Since when do you[A]
care about other people?[AN]
It's very unlike you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you think so, sir?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Oh, yes.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I even joked with Trec saying[A]
that you fancied the lass.[AN]
But THAT wouldn't be like you[A]
in the least, now would it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

## Ch7_ZelotRecruitsTrec
[OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Trec, we're now in service
to the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]OK, I guess.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Not the most enthusiastic[A]
response. You don't like the idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Wha?
No, it's fine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, well, all right then.[A]
Get to it then.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia, huh...?[A]
Eh, it should all work out.[AN][X]

## Ch7_RoyRecruitsTrec
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you one of the[A]
Ilian mercenaries?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Hmmm?[A]
Yeah, I guess so.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I lead the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'll take your orders[A]
from now on then.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Just like that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You don't have to check in[A]
with your commander first?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh. Nah.[AN]
He already said we're joining[A]
the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But still...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Really, it's fine.[A]
This is a battle.[AN]
There's no time to check every[A]
little thing with the commander.[AN]
It's not as though I'm going[A]
against his orders anyway.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...All right.[AN][X]

## Ch7_NoahRecruitsZelot
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[AN]
I heard you were[A]
at the arena.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,[A]
sorry I'm late.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry yourself...[A]
Things are just getting started.[AN]
I haven't even spoken with the[A]
Lycian Army's commander yet.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[AN]
Actually, I just spoke[A]
to him.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[AN]
Then we'll take any commands[A]
he gives from now on.[AN]
Noah, I leave further negotiations[A]
with the Lycian League to you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![AN][X]

## Ch7_TrecRecruitsZelot
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Trec.[A]
What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I just met with the commander[A]
of the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, did you?[AN]
Then we'll take any commands[A]
he gives from now on.[AN]
Trec, I leave further negotiations[A]
with the Lycian League to you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![AN][X]


## Ch7_LongbowVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]Look at this great[A]
bow I made.[AN]
It fires arrows much farther[A]
than a normal bow![AN]
Very useful, don't you think?[A]
Of course you do.[AN]
You can have it.[A]
I want it to go to good use.[AN][X]

## Ch7_TorchStaffVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, this? This is a torch staff.[A]
It creates light in foggy places.[AN]
If you're in fog, you can't[A]
attack anything you can't see.[AN]
This should be helpful if you ever[A]
find yourself in that situation.[AN][X]

## Ch7_ElixirVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
[OpenMidRight]Would you like to buy some elixir?[A]
It'll patch your wounds right up![AN]
The recipe is top secret...[A]
Don't ask, because I'm not telling![AN]
What's that?[A]
You don't want any?[AN]
Here, I'll give you a free sample![A]
You won't be disappointed.[AN][X]

## Ch7_RedGemVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
[ToggleSmile]Ostia is Lycia's greatest city![A]
But now look at it...[AN]
What did you say? You're out[A]
to restore our former glory?[AN]
Then please,[A]
take this gem...[AN]
It'll fetch a high price[A]
at any store![AN]
Just use the money[A]
to help Ostia![AN][X]

## Ch7_PhysicVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager12]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you going to help Lady Lilina?[AN]
Here's a staff that can heal[A]
injuries from a distance![AN]
If Lady Lilina's hurt,[A]
please heal her...[AN][X]

## Ch7_KillingEdgeVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A while back, I saw a man[A]
dying in the street.[AN]
I helped him out, and he gave[A]
me this sword.[AN]
Really strange person, but kind...[A]
Hm? This is the sword.[AN]
You can have it![A]
Take good care of it.[AN][X]

## Ch7_HeroCrestVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]General Legance has allied[A]
himself with Bern![AN]
He had all who resisted him[A]
killed... I escaped, though.[AN]
Please take this. It's a[A]
Hero crest.[AN]
Give this to an experienced hero,[A]
and fight to save Ostia...[AN][X]

## Ch7_HorseslayerVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]
Cavaliers, paladins...[A]
Mounted knights like those.[AN]
This lance is incredibly effective[A]
against such soldiers.[AN]
There are many horsemen in the rebel[A]
army, so use this against them![AN][X]

## Ch7_End
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The city is finally[A]
under control.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Now let us retake Castle Ostia[A]
and rescue Lilina![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy, I understand your[A]
apprehension, but please be patient![AN]
We still need to break down[A]
the castle gate.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Speaking of Lady Lilina...[AN]
What do you think of what[A]
Lord Hector said?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You mean about the dragons?[AN]
They were real, not just myth...[AN]
Lord Hector was one of the[A]
greatest tacticians in Lycia.[AN]
And yet his army was defeated in[A]
the blink of an eye...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's army is perhaps the[A]
strongest in Elibe.[AN]
I say, those wyvern riders were[A]
indeed very formidable opponents.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course the wyvern riders must[A]
have been difficult enough.[AN]
But the dragons... I can't even[A]
conceive how powerful they must be.[AN]
Lord Hector mentioned a weapon that[A]
is effective against dragons...[AN]
I wonder where it's hidden.[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume it must be one of[A]
the legendary weapons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If we can obtain those, we might have a[A]
fighting chance against the dragons.[AN]
But I do wonder what a legendary[A]
weapon is doing in Ostia.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps Lady Lilina knows[A]
the answer. I'm curious as well.[AN]
Oh![AN]
Lord Roy, our men have finished[A]
knocking down the gate.[AN]
We can enter now![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]All right! Forward charge![AN]
Rescue Lilina, no matter[A]
the cost![AN][X]
