[MoveMidRight]The enemy has broken[A]
into the castle?![AN]
How could Debias have[A]
failed against them?![AN]
Were those Ilian mercenaries[A]
that skilled?[AN]
...Or was the Lycian Army larger[A]
than we expected...?[AN]
Whatever the case, they have broken into[A]
the impregnable Castle Ostia![AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]We must defeat them here, or we'll[A]
be a laughing stock in Bern...[AN][Clear]
You over there![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, General![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Have the troops take defensive positions[A]
throughout the castle![AN]
Particularly around the throne room![AN]
We must not allow the Lycian Army[A]
any further into the castle![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, General![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]One other matter.[AN]
I want you to have Lilina quietly[A]
assassinated during the battle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]What? ...I thought we[A]
were to keep her alive.[AN]
[OpenRight]I felt she might make[A]
a valuable hostage.[AN]
But many of our rebel soldiers[A]
still swear loyalty to her.[AN]
If we openly use her as a hostage,[A]
those soldiers may turn.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]If that's the case, General, would they not[A]
also turn if we assassinate her?[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]That's why I said to do[A]
it quietly, isn't it?![AN]
Kill her discreetly, and say that[A]
she was hit by a stray arrow.[AN]
We can hold the enemy responsible![A]
Now go![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, General...[AN][X]

## Ch8_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][.....]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAstolfo]...General Roy of Pherae,[A]
I presume.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Who are you?![A]
An enemy?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no. I'm on your side.[A]
My name is Astolfo.[AN]
I used to work here in the[A]
service of the marquess.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]What kind of work were[A]
you doing exactly?[AN]
You certainly aren't dressed[A]
like a servant...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]A bit nosy, don't you[A]
think, old man?[AN]
I'm a spy, see.[AN]
I gather information, steal things,[A]
check on people... Things like that.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]That explains it.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm not much of a spy if you can tell I[A]
work for a noble at first glance, am I?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been running around Lycia gathering[A]
intelligence for about a month now.[AN]
When I heard about Araphen, I got back[A]
as quickly as my legs would allow.[AN]
And what do I find but those muttonheads[A]
Legance and Debias inciting rebellion![AN]
I couldn't save Lord Hector, but I[A]
won't let them take Lady Lilina.[AN]
[OpenRight]Then you'll join us?[A]
Do you know where Lilina is?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Of course. Finding that[A]
stuff out is my job.[AN]
Lady Lilina is locked in a small room[A]
in the heart of the castle.[AN]
And Legance is sitting on the[A]
throne like he owns the place.[AN]
[OpenRight]We have to hurry then.[AN]
We must defeat the rebels and save Lilina[A]
before Narcian arrives from Bern![AN][X]

## Ch8_LilinaNoise
[OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's all that noise?[A]
Is there a battle going on?[AN]
I wish I could see outside[A]
this chamber...[AN][X]

## Ch8_OstiaSquadAppears
[OpenFarRight][LoadOgier][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Sir Barthe,[A]
it's a dead end![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][CloseSpeechFast]This wall has cracks in it.[AN]
We can break it down if we hit[A]
it with our weapons.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadGwendolyn]I wonder where[A]
Lady Lilina is.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a pretty good idea[A]
of where she might be.[AN]
I've known this castle[A]
for a long time.[AN]
I do wonder what's causing[A]
all the noise, though.[AN]
[OpenRight]The Lycian Army, perhaps?[AN]
My brother must be[A]
with them...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...We can't be sure he's[A]
still alive.[AN]
You had best keep your[A]
hopes low.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Ah...[A]
Yes, you're right.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Barthe, must you[A]
be so aloof?[AN]
Bors is Gwendolyn's only brother.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]We must always stand[A]
firmly in reality.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]But--[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]It's all right, Ogier.[A]
Sir Barthe is right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As a knight of Ostia,[A]
you must always remain calm.[AN]
It matters not how grave the[A]
situation.[AN]
Understood, Gwendolyn?[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]...Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch8_CathAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath]Oh baby![AN]
Just as I thought.[A]
They're at it again.[AN]
How stupid can these[A]
nobles get?[AN]
I'll never understand what fun[A]
it is fighting all the time.[AN]
Oh well. I'll take the opportunity[A]
to swipe what I can.[AN][X]

## Ch8_RoyLilinaTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]Lilina![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina]...Roy?[.....]
Is it really you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, it's me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You came![A]
Thank you so much.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm so glad you're unhurt.[A]
Here, take this spell tome.[AN]
Use it to defend yourself for[A]
the time being.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thanks.[AN][X]

## Ch8_BorsGwendolynTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][NormalPrint]Bors!
You're all right![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBors][FastPrint]Is that you, Gwendolyn?[AN]
I'm so glad to see[A]
you in one piece.[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Wha...!? What...what's[A]
that you're wearing?![AN]
Did you join up with[A]
the Ostian knights?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Actually, yes.[A]
I was knighted just yesterday.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What are you thinking...?[AN]
I told you to leave the fighting[A]
to me and live as you wish![AN]
You didn't need to become[A]
a knight...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I thought about it, and I[A]
realized that this is what I want.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't want to sit idly by and wait[A]
for you to return from battle.[AN]
I want to be a great knight,[A]
just like you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Bors?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You've always been a[A]
stubborn one, Gwendolyn.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Live as you wish.[AN]
If Mother and Father were alive,[A]
I'm certain they'd say the same...[AN]
But the life of a knight[A]
is never easy![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm prepared![A]
I'm ready for the challenge![AN][X]

## Ch8_BorsLilinaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
Lady Lilina![A]
You are unharmed![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors, I'm sorry that[A]
I worried you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, milady![A]
You are well...[AN]
That in itself is[A]
enough for me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors.[AN]
And you kept your promise[A]
to protect Roy.[AN]
I knew I could[A]
depend on you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, milady![AN][X]

## Ch8_BartheLilinaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBarthe]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina![A]
I am overjoyed to see you safe.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe, you were right.[A]
Legance was planning this rebellion.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[AN]
If only I'd trusted your word,[A]
this would not have happened...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No...[AN]
Lady Lilina, you have[A]
nothing to apologize for.[AN]
Legance betrayed your[A]
kindness and trust.[AN]
He is the one responsible[A]
for this.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]It is your undying kindness that we[A]
soldiers respect the most, milady.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Barthe...[AN][X]

## Ch8_End1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]We've finally retaken[A]
the castle, Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Roy.[AN]
I'm glad that my father didn't have[A]
to go to the trouble.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, is my father still in Araphen?[AN]
I heard there was a horrible battle there,[A]
but how much longer will he be?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[A]
You haven't heard?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heard what?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector...[A]
passed on.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry... By the time we arrived[A]
at Castle Araphen...[AN]
It was already under Bern's control.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not your fault...[A]
Don't apologize.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Hector had been fatally[A]
wounded when we arrived.[AN]
If only we had gotten there sooner,[A]
we could have helped him...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I...was prepared for this...[AN]
I'm the daughter of[A]
a warrior.[AN]
I've been taught to steel myself[A]
in times such as these.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Everybody kept it from me...[A]
They didn't want to hurt me...[AN]
But I'm strong... I can[A]
handle this...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina, you don't have[A]
to hold back...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We'll get through this...[A]
I'm here for you.[AN][X]

## Ch8Ch8x_WyvernsAtOstia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy! Bern's wyvern riders[A]
are in front of Castle Ostia![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?![A]
They're here already?![AN][X]

## Ch8Ch8x_NarcianAppears
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenFarRight][LoadRoy][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hm [.....]hm [.....]hm...[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]You must be Roy.[AN]
I thank you for ridding me[A]
of that cretin Legance.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Now, leave Ostia to me and we can all[A]
go home with our limbs attached.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Never![AN]
I'll never hand Ostia over to[A]
the likes of you...![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oho?[AN]
You think you can best us with that[A]
sad little group of yours?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]I will cut you open,[A]
just as I did to Hector![AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]That's enough![AN][X]

## Ch8Ch8x_EtruriansAppear
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][.....]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]General Narcian![A]
A legion has arrived from Etruria![AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that, you fool![A]
But why...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][FastPrint]I am Perceval,[A]
Knight General of Etruria.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]Mage General Cecilia informed me that the[A]
Lycian Army had requested Etruria's aid.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...?![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]We are prepared for battle.[AN]
Can those wyvern riders of yours[A]
stand against our might?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...![AN]
[OpenMidRight]I am Cecilia,[A]
Mage General of Etruria![AN]
Ostia is now under our[A]
protection.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Argh...![A]
You...you...!!![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]General Narcian,[A]
please control your temper![AN]
General Perceval is one of the[A]
most skilled knights in Etruria![AN]
Combined with General Cecilia,[A]
we haven't a chance![AN]
[OpenLeft]I know that![A]
We're leaving![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]Cecilia, was it?[AN]
We'll see who has[A]
the last laugh![AN][X]

## Ch8Ch8x_PercevalGigaChad
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you General Roy of[A]
the Lycian Army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, I am![AN]
I lead the Lycian Army[A]
in Lord Hector's place.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure.[AN]
You have my sympathy for the[A]
current turmoil in Lycia.[AN]
Our king also sends his[A]
condolences for Lord Hector.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[AN]
If you hadn't helped us...Ostia[A]
would be under Bern's control now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.[A]
I simply followed my king's orders.[AN]
You should thank Cecilia. She defied the[A]
king until he agreed to help you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]She...[A]
opposed the king?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, she put her neck on the line.[AN]
Well, I must be off.[AN]
Etruria calls. As one of the three Generals[A]
of Etruria, it requires my presence.[AN]
Cecilia,[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][A]
[OpenMidLeft]will you take care of the loose ends?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Thank you, Perceval.[A]
Leave the rest to me.[AN][X]

## Ch8Ch8x_CeciliaTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Wow...[A]
General Perceval...[AN]
Just his presence was[A]
intimidating.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][ToggleSmile]Nervous, were you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia![A]
It is good to see you again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]How are you, Roy?[A]
You look a little tired.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm fine, thanks to you.[A]
It could have been a calamity.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad we made[A]
it in time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry I put you through[A]
so much trouble.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be.[AN]
It will benefit Etruria for Ostia[A]
to go under our protection.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Benefit Etruria?[A]
How?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's been increasingly[A]
aggressive, as you know.[AN]
If Bern gains any further strength, the[A]
balance of power will be shattered.[AN]
Still, we haven't been attacked, so[A]
we couldn't simply declare war.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So when we requested aid, it was[A]
justification to declare war on Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Precisely.[AN]
We only did what is[A]
best for our land.[AN]
You needn't feel that[A]
you're in our debt.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]If you insist.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Regardless, please come in and[A]
meet the rest of the army.[AN][X]
