## Chapter9_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan][OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Boss! The Lycians[N]
are here![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You sure?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh yeah. We just saw 'em dock at[N]
that little island in the east.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good. They're probably floundering[N]
about in this thick fog.[AN]
Sneak up from where they can't[N]
see and finish 'em.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, Boss.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, I'm sorry that[N]
I couldn't stop this.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It isn't your responsibility, General[N]
Cecilia. Don't concern yourself.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Even in Etruria people dislike how the high[N]
chancellor treats the Lycians as pawns.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]High chancellor? I thought the king[N]
made the decision to send us here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Actually, he didn't. High Chancellor Roartz[N]
works closely with Lord Arcardo,[AN]
the noble who heads the mining operations[N]
here in the Western Isles.[AN]
They made the decision without[N]
consulting the king.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They have that power?[AN]
How?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Did you hear of the tragedy that[N]
occurred in Etruria last year?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
Prince Myrddin, next in line to be king,[N]
abruptly passed away last year.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I never had the honor to[N]
make his acquaintance.[AN]
I understand that he was a very[N]
bright individual.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... Were the prince alive, Etruria[N]
would surely not be in this sad shape.[AN]
King Mordred was overcome with sorrow[N]
when his son departed.[AN]
The shock was so great that he has[N]
yet to recover.[AN]
Of late, it seems he's always detached[N]
from reality.[AN]
He pays no mind to anything happening[N]
around him or in the kingdom.[AN][Clear]
Roartz is exploiting the king's[N]
condition for his own benefit.[AN]
Now, he's essentially in charge[N]
of the goings-on in the palace.[AN]
He keeps the three Etrurian Generals,[N]
Perceval, Douglas, and myself,[AN]
away from the king except in times[N]
of great urgency.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_Start3
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But what about when you came[N]
to our aid in Ostia?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That was an exception because[N]
I had Perceval behind me.[AN]
But I'm sorry, I didn't have[N]
the clout to prevent this...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't blame you.[AN]
We will return to Lycia as soon as[N]
we complete our mission here.[AN]
But please, I only ask that you take[N]
care of Lycia in our absence.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You needn't ask.[AN]
The Lycian League is in safe hands,[N]
as is Princess Guinivere.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere]Roy...[N]
May I not go with you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The battles on these islands[N]
are likely to be ugly.[AN]
I can't predict what might[N]
happen.[AN]
You should stay in hiding in Etruria[N]
with General Cecilia's protection.[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadCecilia]You can trust me, Your Highness.[AN]
I know you want a truce to end[N]
this war.[AN]
I will defend you no[N]
matter the cost.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...I understand.[N]
I'm truly sorry to trouble you.[AN]
Roy, I pray for your safety.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Your Highness.[N]
I will pray for yours as well.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_ScottSendsFir
[OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Scott![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, Fir.[N]
Sorry to call you in.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's going on out there?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The island is under[N]
attack by pirates.[AN]
They've come to kill the[N]
people living here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]What?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I sent some guys over to try and stop[N]
them, but the pirates are very skilled.[AN]
The outlook isn't good.[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]I can't believe it...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'd like to fight them myself,[N]
but I can't leave this castle.[AN]
Fir, I'm sorry, but can[N]
you go in my place?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. I will go and purge the[N]
people of these pirates.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yeah, thanks.[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave them to my blade![AN]
Anyone who attacks innocent villagers[N]
will get no mercy from me![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I have someone you[N]
can work with too.[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]You do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yeah. He's a nomad named Sin.[AN]
He's a little skinny, but he's[N]
a decent shot with his bow.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_ScottFirWoDao
[OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan][ToggleSmile]Boss, you sure? I mean, that[N]
girl won't have any chance...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know what I'm doing.[AN]
Once she's killed, we can take[N]
that sword she's carrying.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The sword?[N]
That weird one she has?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not just any weird sword. It's a[N]
Wo Dao, a famous blade from the east.[AN]
It's worth a fortune. Heh heh...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ohhh, I get it now.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]That's why you were so[N]
hospitable to her.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't do anything before,[N]
but now's our chance.[AN]
I want you to follow her.[AN]
Once she's finished, take the sword[N]
from her lifeless hands![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, Boss![AN][X]

## Chapter9_FirAndSinHeadOut
[OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you...[N]
Sin?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[AN]
I heard everything from Scott.[N]
Let's go.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]So, uh...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Uh, are you here to[N]
protect the villagers like me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I have no interest[N]
in such things.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then why are you here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm paid to fight.[.....][N]
That is all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...I need to keep the [N]
conversation going.[AN][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSin][.....][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... You're from Sacae,[N]
right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What brings you all[N]
the way out here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Nothing special. You appear to be[N]
from Sacae yourself.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]As for me, I'm traveling around[N]
Elibe to train myself, and...[AN]
Oh, you didn't ask about me,[N]
did you...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...Sigh.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I'm looking for someone.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Who?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...My clan was crushed by Bern[N]
when they invaded Sacae.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight]Our chieftain had me escape and told me[N]
to find and protect his granddaughter.[AN]
I'm still in search of her.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[N]
Well, I hope you find her.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Me too.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_NoahRecruitsFir
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Fir![N]
It is you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Sir Noah?![N]
What are you doing here?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I joined this army[N]
back in Ostia...[.....] Whoa![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][ToggleSmile]What are you doing?![N]
Sheathe your sword![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Noah! You aren't the noble[N]
man I thought you were![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know you're a mercenary...[N]
But lending your services to pirates?![AN]
You should be ashamed![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't act like you don't know![AN]
You're working with pirates to[N]
attack the people living here![AN]
And you call yourself a knight?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hold on, I think there's been[N]
some kind of misunderstanding...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misunderstanding?![N]
You still have the nerve--[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We're trying to help[N]
the villagers.[AN]
Our goal is to defeat the[N]
head of the pirate group here.[AN]
His name is Scott, I think.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Scott is the head[N]
of the pirates?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sure is. If you don't believe me why[N]
don't you ask the pirate over there?[AN]
The one behind you, hiding in[N]
the bushes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pirate?[N]
What pirate--?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The plan failed! I gotta[N]
go tell the boss![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hey![N]
Come back here![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You didn't suspect[N]
them at all?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Scott was very[N]
kind to me...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Really? The rumors say that[N]
he's a brute of a man...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My mother always said that you shouldn't[N]
judge a person by their looks...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, certainly,[N]
but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I was fighting for[N]
pirates this whole time...[AN]
What should I do now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you want to[N]
come with us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Truly?[N]
Can I?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We're always looking for new[N]
recruits to bolster our strength.[AN]
I'll talk to Roy for you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you![AN][X]

## Chapter9_SueRecruitsSin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Sue![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sin...[N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I was looking for you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]For me? Why?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The chieftain told me to.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...What happened to[N]
the clan after I left?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We were no equal[N]
for Bern...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...We lost.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What happened to[N]
my grandfather?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He still continues the[N]
resistance against Bern...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Is that so...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I was told by the chieftain[N]
to find and protect you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then you will fight[N]
alongside us?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]With you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]This army is fighting against Bern, like[N]
my grandfather. They also saved my life.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Then of course.[AN]
If that is what you desire,[N]
I am at your disposal.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_SilverSwordVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager43]
[ToggleSmile]This whole area is basically[N]
pirate territory.[AN]
They take everything[N]
from us.[AN][Clear]
Resist, you say?[N]
It's of no use.[AN]
They can do whatever they want[N]
because of their numbers.[AN]
We can't fight against them[N]
like the resistance force.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_BarrierVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager46]
[Clear]You saved us![AN]
Are you with the resistance?[.....][N]
No?[AN]
Then you just did it out of the[N]
goodness of your heart?[AN]
As I'm sure you've seen, these islands[N]
are swarming with pirates and bandits![AN]
There's nothing we can do out here,[AN]
but word is the resistance is waging[N]
battle in the western part of the Isles.[AN]
Tell them we'll all move to the mainland.[N]
They don't have to worry about us...[AN][X]

## Chapter9_KillerBowVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager41]
[ToggleSmile]The only people here are[N]
women and children.[AN]
All the workers have been[N]
taken north to the mines.[AN]
They aren't even allowed to rest.[N]
They're forced to work until they die...[AN]
My brother escaped, but he[N]
was reduced to skin and bone.[AN]
That day he came back, he was already[N]
too weak, and he drew his last breath...[AN]
Now that I've told you this...can you...[AN]
Er, sorry...[AN]
I've said too much.[N]
Please forget all of this.[AN]
We'll leave the Isles now.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_MistHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
There's so much mist here...[AN]
In these conditions, you can never[N]
know if someone's waiting to pounce![AN]
Torches can be very useful, even if[N]
you have an eagle-eyed thief with you.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_NorthOrWestHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager44]
The resistance is faring quite well.[AN]
In the north and in the west,[N]
they're always engaged in battle.[AN]
Which way will you go?[AN][X]

## Chapter9_SinWarningHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager42]
Among the pirates is a very[N]
skilled nomad...[AN]
You can't see him[N]
through all this fog,[AN]
but he also has a girl[N]
with him...[AN][X]

## Chapter9_FleeingToMainlandVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager44]
The nearby villagers...[AN]
They're all deserting the[N]
Isles for the mainland.[AN]
It's very sad, really.[AN]
If you want to visit, you'd[N]
best do it quickly.[AN]
You won't have time to go to both,[N]
so you'll have to decide.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_End1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, it appeared the enemy[N]
was trying to ambush us...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They must have known[N]
we were coming.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I think there's more to this[N]
than we realize...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right. Clearing out the bandits[N]
may be more difficult than expected.[AN]
Ever since Bern's aggressive behavior[N]
started, Elibe has changed.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't even know what to expect...[AN]
Dragons appearing, Bern's sudden invasion,[N]
the collapse of the Lycian League...[AN]
Everything happened so suddenly.[AN]
In the end I suppose all we can do is[N]
take it one problem at a time.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_EndNorth
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...[N]
Where do we go from here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's move north[N]
along the coast.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]North...[N]
Toward the mines?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[AN]
I hear the people living on the islands are[N]
being forced into slave labor there.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you think we[N]
should rescue them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If we do, we might be able to[N]
find out who's behind all of this.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must start[N]
somewhere.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's not waste time...[N]
Let's head north.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_EndWest
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...[N]
Where do we go from here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's head west.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]West?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I heard there's a resistance[N]
group based there.[AN]
They're fighting the bandits[N]
to protect the villagers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They may have information on[N]
what's going on in the Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed.[N]
We need a lead.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems like a sound idea,[N]
Lord Roy.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's not waste time.[N]
Let's move west.[AN][X]

## Chapter9_EndNorthNoVillage
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Now...[N]
Where do we go from here?[AN]
We must choose a direction.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do you have any ideas?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If we follow the coast north, we will[N]
reach the largest mine on the Isles.[AN]
The bandits may be based[N]
around there.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, that makes sense.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We have an assignment, and it's[N]
to get rid of the bandits.[AN]
We mustn't wander about[N]
aimlessly wasting time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You're right.[N]
Let's head north![AN][X]
