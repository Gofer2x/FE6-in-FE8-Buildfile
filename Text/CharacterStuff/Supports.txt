[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's not good?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The young recruits. Their combat[N]
skills leave much to be desired.[AN]
Granted, not all of them are[N]

Lord Roy, I believe training needs[N]
to be made more difficult.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]More difficult?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, my lord.[AN]
And those who fail to perform[N]
up to par should be discharged.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
Such rules may make our numbers small,[N]

[OpenMidLeft]No, Marcus.[N]
I don't think so.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[N]

I was just thinking about[N]

[OpenMidRight]How to move the troops?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The enemy grows stronger all the time[N]
so strategies quickly become obsolete.[AN]
I was wondering how to effectively[N]
break through their defensive lines.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
That's easy, Lord Roy![N]
Just allow me to charge in.[AN]
I will shatter their shields[N]

Lord Roy, I have an idea of how to[N]
break through the enemy's defenses...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]An idea?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We leave our best troops behind, and send[N]
the weaker ones to the front lines.[AN]
Once the enemies are weakened, the stronger[N]
troops will be able to finish them.[AN]
Please, allow me to be in the front lines[N]
with the other weaker soldiers![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But then we would risk losing you[N]
and everyone you're with...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We might suffer some casualties,[N]
but we will win the battle![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Alen, I can't[N]
use that idea.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]W-why not, milord?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can't use a strategy that I[N]
know will cause casualties.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
But Lord Roy, casualties[N]
are unavoidable in war...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think not.[AN]
It may be naive to say so, but a victory[N]
with casualties is no victory at all.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]

Lord Eliwood and his wife?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, milady, just looking at them[N]
would fill one with cheer.[AN]
The people of Pherae were truly[N]

[OpenMidRight]That sounds nice...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.[AN]
One night...before the two were[N]
wed, Lord Eliwood disappeared.[AN]
He returned three days later, and[N]
presented his wife a flower.[AN]
It was a beautiful white flower that[N]
grows only in the snowy highlands.[AN]

Actually, this is perfect. Let me[N]

[OpenMidLeft]If it is within my meager[N]

[OpenMidRight]All right, so, axes are[N]
weak against swords.[AN]
That much is common sense.[AN]
What I'm wondering is why it's[N]
that way to begin with.[AN]
I don't understand the[N]

That's what's troubling me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. I wondered the same[N]

I found the answer after going[N]

[OpenMidRight]Is it...the[N]
weapon's weight?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[AN]
All weapons are designed by[N]
humans.[AN]
As such, an invincible weapon[N]
with no flaws is inconceivable.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying a weapon will[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Right.[AN]

orphanage I used to live in.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]He sounds like a good man.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, he sure was![AN]
Well, I need to hurry[N]
with this herb.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Do you?[N]
Is someone hurt?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, a traveler was hit[N]
by a stray arrow.[AN]
It's not a large wound, but[N]
the bleeding won't stop.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]My healing staff will be more[N]
effective than the herb.[AN]
Can you show me to this[N]
traveler?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?![N]
You'll help him out?![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's hurry![N]
This way![AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sister Elen![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hello, Chad.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks for your help[N]
before.[AN]
The traveler made[N]
a full recovery.[AN]
He wanted me to[N]
thank you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I only did what[N]
anyone would have.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No way! I've never met anyone willing to[N]
use a pricy healing staff on a commoner.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Only those with the St. Elimine[N]
Church treat commoners with staves.[AN]
And even then, it's only when the[N]
wound is lethal or something.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Really?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, at least that's how it is in the[N]
Lycian countryside where I grew up.[AN]
But that's why we learned how to use[N]
herbs and things.[AN]
...At least until Bern invaded.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I...see.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa! S-sorry, I didn't mean to[N]
make you feel down or anything...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's not your fault...[N]
I just can't believe...[AN]
I can't believe my...home country[N]
would start this war...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sister Elen, are you...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. I...come from Bern.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Wait! Don't go![AN]
Please...[N]
Listen to me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]My country started this war.[AN]
So I understand...if you resent[N]
a person of Bern like me...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]But why?[AN]
I see no hatred in your eyes.[N]
Only sorrow.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Would you...tell me about it?[AN]
I think it may release some of[N]
the burden on your shoulders...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
...Poppa...the father of our orphanage...[N]
He was killed by Bern's soldiers...[AN]
We had a little garden where[N]
we grew food.[AN]
The soldiers... They trampled it with[N]
their horses because...[AN]
because they said it was in the way.[AN]
It was a tiny garden with nothing[N]
but roots, and yet they still...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then...Poppa was killed[N]
protecting the garden?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah... It may have been just a bunch[N]
of roots...but it was our food.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, you can cry...[N]
If you feel sad, let it out.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was the oldest of the orphans,[N]
so I can't cry.[AN]
The little kids and my best[N]
friend Lugh...[AN]
They went into shock seeing[N]
Poppa killed before their eyes.[AN]
It was my job to take care[N]
of them.[AN]
I don't want to lose any more[N]
family... That's why I fight.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're strong.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My hatred for Bern fuels my[N]
strength...[AN]
The drive to avenge Poppa and[N]
protect all the orphans...[AN]
That was my purpose in life.[N]
It felt just![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Do you hesitate now?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I hated everyone from Bern.[AN]
I thought they only cared[N]
about themselves.[AN]
...Until I met you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Chad... I'm on your side.[AN]
Regardless of my home...I want[N]
to help you.[AN]
Do you hate me...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I don't know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then I'll stay at your[N]
side, Chad.[AN]
I can't replace Poppa...[AN]
But the least I can do is be[N]
there for you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Have it your way![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Chad.[AN]

I'm still uneasy about allowing such[N]
a small child into battle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I look so small?[AN]
But if that's how you want to[N]
play it,[AN]
then isn't it just as dangerous to[N]
send a frail lady like you into battle?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That...may be true, but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yep![AN]
So if you're ever in danger,[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Truly, being able to meet such a beautiful[N]

And you are a follower of the[N]
St. Elimine Church, no less![AN]
This meeting must have been part of[N]
some divine plan.[AN]
Please, let us meet this evening so that[N]
we can discuss the love of the gods.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to.[N]
What time can you meet?[AN]
I am free all night...[AN]

there's no...satisfaction.[AN]

But Elen, are you sure?[AN]
With a woman like you, I may lose[N]
control, and...do things.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not worried.[N]
You are a priest.[AN]
I'm sure you would[N]
never do such a thing.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Good day, Brother Saul.[N]
It is good to see you well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You are so tense, so stressed![N]
You must relax your muscles.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Absolutely. Those in service to the gods[N]
must learn to unwind once in a while.[AN]
You should enjoy the finer things in[N]
life at times, as I do.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I once knew a lady like you...[AN]
Well, not "knew" so much as[N]
"was slapped by", but...[AN]
If you serve the gods, you must[N]
experience all of their creation.[AN]
You can experience things that will[N]
open your eyes...[AN]
Things that you will not believe.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh my, yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Life is all about the[N]
experiences we can have.[AN]
Shall we discuss meeting[N]
this evening again?[AN]
I am free at any time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That would be marvelous.[N]
I would love to hear you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Excellent. Then...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I shall invite the[N]
others as well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?[N]
The others?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes. If you will preach, then let[N]

We can try again some[N]

so selfless.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Selfless?[N]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes. You appear to be an[N]
impious womanizer.[AN]
Hardly someone I would call[N]
a priest.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there is[N]
a reason for that.[AN]
It is a character act.[AN]
It is to show that the St. Elimine[N]
Church accepts even the lowest of men.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[AN]
I, uh... Hmm. OK.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting as you do ruins your[N]
reputation and image...[AN]
Everyone thinks you're lazy and[N]
only interested in women...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But the truth is that you do it for[N]
the church.[AN]
I could not sacrifice myself as you do.[N]
You have my respect, Brother Saul.[AN]

Well, anyway, just remember to[N]

What I'm saying now[N]

[OpenMidRight]To sellswords...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]A sellsword has to fend for[N]
him or herself.[AN]
No one's gonna watch[N]

Always question others.[N]
You should even question me.[AN]
Question whether my orders[N]
serve the group,[AN]
or if they're just putting you in[N]
harm's way to protect myself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't think that's[N]
necessary.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You would never make[N]
orders like that.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You can never be sure.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where did she go?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Ward.[AN]
What are you[N]
doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I told you to leave this[N]
area to me.[AN]
That means you don't go[N]
flying around on your own![AN]
We have to follow Roy's[N]
orders...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But if we sit around waiting for[N]
orders all the time,[AN]
we could miss an opportunity![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you get it?![AN]
What if you flew out by yourself[N]
into a bunch of enemy archers?![AN]
Why don't you just think before[N]
you act...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[AN]
I thought you were angry about[N]
me fighting without you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![AN]
We need to work as[N]
a team in battle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Then what was all that about[N]
the archers and stuff?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Uh![AN]
Th-that was...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Were you worried about me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-w-what are you talking about?![N]
N-n-no way![AN]
Y-you just don't know how to[N]
act in battle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward, you're stuttering.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Err...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ward.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[AN]

How did you know?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can tell by your face.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Really? That's actually[N]
kind of impressive...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back to your[N]
hometown after the war?[AN]
If you are, I could use[N]
your help.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help with what?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning to build a new village for[N]
people who lost their homes in the war.[AN]
I can't do it myself, though.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you[N]
want me to do?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, there are plenty of things[N]
you could do.[AN]
Chop firewood, clean the laundry,[N]
help with cooking...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm no servant.[N]
I live the mercenary life.[AN]
Sorry, but you better ask[N]
someone else...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'll help us? Fantastic![N]
I knew you would.[AN] 
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, that's not what I said![N]
Were you even listening?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sure I was. But I can[N]
tell that you want to.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I don't![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see in your eyes[N]
your desire to help.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again...[N]
I'm not helping, all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trust me, you don't want to be[N]
a mercenary.[AN]
You never know when you[N]
could die.[AN]
And you're weak, so that'll be[N]
sooner rather than later.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grr... You'll regret[N]
saying that...[AN]
You don't want to see[N]
me when I'm angry.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What are you looking at me[N]
like that for?![AN]
I've slain monsters stronger[N]
than any human![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, now that's something.[AN]
What kind of beasts?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Near my village...[N]
there's this weird cave.[AN]
When I was a kid, people said[N]
it was filled with monsters.[AN]
So one day I got my friend Lot[N]
and we went to defeat them.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The cave was dark and damp...[N]
Something seemed wrong.[AN]
Lot was scared, but I was fine.[AN]
I led the way...and finally,[N]
there they were.[AN]
The monsters were crawling all[N]
over the cave floor.[AN]
Long, skinny bodies slithering[N]
about, all scaly and spotted...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Snakes?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess they were kind of like snakes.[N]
But these were no ordinary snakes.[AN]
They were monsters, with poison and[N]
strange dances and weird moves...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah... Snakes.[N]
Anyway, where is this cave?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'll go check it out on my[N]
way to the village site.[AN]
I'm curious now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]B-but I already killed[N]
all the monsters...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said they were all over[N]
the cave floor.[AN]
Some might have escaped. They were[N]
no ordinary snakes, right?[AN]
I want to see them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grr...[AN]

## WardEchidnaSupportA
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft]Well, we meet again.[AN]
Doesn't looking at my face[N]
make you want to help out?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[AN]
...But...[AN][ToggleSmile]
When the war is over, I might[N]
just stop by my old home.[AN]
And if I get bored, maybe I'll[N]
come and help a little.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have family[N]
back home?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, an older sister who never[N]
stops yelling at me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[AN]
You're pretty stupid,[N]
you know that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Stupid?[AN]
What do you mean[N]
by stupid, you--[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got a home to return to.[AN]
You've got someone waiting[N]
for you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Help us out if you have time,[N]
but your sister is more important.[AN]
Do you understand?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, yeah, I know...[AN]
Can't wait for her[N]
to scold me again...[AN]

## LotShannaSupportC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, don't come out[N]
front so often.[AN]
Pegasi are easy prey[N]
for archers.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And you're frail, so make sure[N]
you retreat from danger.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lot! You're such a worrywart.[N]
I am a knight.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're still[N]
in training.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yeah, but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Just remember that you can never[N]
be overly cautious in battle.[AN]
Staying wary will keep you alive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, yeah.[AN]

## LotShannaSupportB
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, you can't always[N]
charge in like that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But Lot...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No buts.[N]
You should be more--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lot?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why are you always so[N]
concerned about me?[AN]
Oh wait, I get it.[AN][Clear]
Aww, I never knew you felt[N]
that way about me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, you wish.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's not it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have a little sister back home.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A sister?[AN]
Does she look like[N]
me or something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not in the slightest.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]She's a lot younger than you.[N]
She isn't even ten years old.[AN]
That's why I worry like I do,[N]
fighting in battles like this...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Shanna, you have an[N]
older sister, right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, two actually.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Then take care of yourself.[N]
If not for your sake, then for them.[AN]
Imagine how they'd feel if[N]
something happened to you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... You're right.[N]
I'll be more careful.[AN]

## LotShannaSupportA
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Hey, Lot![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna.[AN]
You seem to be doing[N]
well lately.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm being more careful now.[N]
I don't rush in anymore.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, not as much as[N]
before, anyway.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, that means I can still[N]
improve, doesn't it...?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something[N]
I wanted to tell you, too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?[N]
What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
A tip for battle![N]
Do you want to hear it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear[N]
for a sec.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK...[N]
Like this?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Don't stress yourself[N]
out so much, Brother.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What the...?![AN]

Western Isles, right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...[N]
How did you know?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Easy. Your face.[AN]
All men from the Isles[N]
have features like yours.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...They do?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back home[N]
after the war?[AN]
If you are, I could[N]
use your help.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning on building a new[N]
village in the Western Isles.[AN]
It'll be for people who lost[N]
their homes during the war.[AN]
I want you to help build it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, I'll do[N]
what I can...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[N]
Thanks.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't make any[N]
promises.[AN]
I can only help if I'm still[N]
alive when the war ends.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Talking like that already?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I only say it because it's[N]
a distinct possibility.[AN]
I'm not one to make empty[N]
promises...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You sure worry a lot for[N]
someone your age.[AN]
You'll be getting gray hairs[N]
before thirty at that rate.[AN]

## LotEchidnaSupportB
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft]Hey, it's you again.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the one who wanted[N]
to build the village...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The planning's going[N]
along smoothly.[AN]
A free village,[N]
open to anybody...[AN]
It's like a dream[N]
coming true.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have the money[N]
to build it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You want logistics now, eh?[AN]
To tell the truth... No.[AN]
But there are mines in the Isles,[AN]
so I just need to go in and find[N]
the mother lode.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That seems pretty unlikely...[AN]
...Oh, wait.[AN]
I know of an old, deserted[N]
gold mine you could try.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I went there with my[N]
friend Ward when I was a kid.[AN]
There were rumors that the place[N]
was haunted, so nobody went near it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Go on.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ward was really scared.[N]
He probably believed the rumors.[AN]
We went in a ways, and Ward let out[N]
a scream and ran for the entrance.[AN]
So I followed him out.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Did he see something?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, snakes.[AN]
Tons of them.[AN]
They covered the whole[N]
cave floor.[AN]
What I want to know is how they[N]
got there in the first place...[AN]
But anyway, the mine was[N]
closed because of them.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see... So there might still[N]
be some gold left in there.[AN]
Sounds interesting.[AN]
We might get enough money for[N]
the village there.[AN]
Say, can you take me when[N]
you get the chance?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't mind...[N]
But it'll be dangerous.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm not worried.[AN]
You'll be there to protect us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[AN]

I need you to survive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.[N]
I have a sister back home.[AN]
And there's also...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing. Never mind.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[AN]
You've got a special somebody[N]
waiting for you, eh?[AN]
Well, well, aren't you a[N]
lucky guy?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I want to go home as soon as[N]
I can, provided I'm alive...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about[N]
that again?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemies get stronger[N]
all the time.[AN]
I don't know how much[N]
longer I'll last.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm confident that we'll win[N]
in the end...[AN]
But I just don't know[N]
that I'll make it home.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on, don't[N]
be stupid.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid now?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone your age should be[N]
enjoying life![AN]
I know you have your sister[N]
to think of.[AN]
But let yourself go once[N]
in a while.[AN]
You might get a few cuts[N]
and bruises, but that's life.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't like cuts[N]
and bruises.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. If you die,[N]
I'll take care of things.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]So go out and get killed![N]
It'll be fine.[AN]
...Trust me.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry I ran off[N]
like that before.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[AN]
I'm glad you're speaking[N]
to me again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I didn't want things to[N]
end like that.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to[N]
my story?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four,[AN]
and ever since then I'd been[N]
living at an orphanage in Lycia.[AN]
It was tiny, with only seven kids and[N]
one priest who we all called Poppa.[AN]
The oldest kids were Chad and my twin[N]
brother Raigh and I,[AN]
so we three took care of the younger[N]
children.[AN]
We were poor, but we were happy[N]
anyway.[AN]
But after Bern started this war,[N]
our lives began to change.[AN]
Food started getting scarce, and we[N]
sometimes had to resort to begging...[AN]
Chad... He started stealing food[N]
without telling Poppa...[AN]
Raigh got fed up with that lifestyle[N]
and left one day without a word.[AN]
I hated Bern... We all did.[AN]
Bern was responsible for everything...[N]
Bern killed Poppa...[AN]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[AN]
..Anger motivates better[N]
than sorrow...[AN]
Anger has kept me alive...[AN]
So that I can protect the[N]
children...[AN][Clear]
...Sigh...[AN]
So...for now, at least until[N]
the war ends...[AN]
I have to stay angry at Bern.[AN][Clear]
...But you're on our side, right?[N]
I don't have to hate you...[AN]
Do I?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It would make me so happy if[N]
you didn't hate me, Lugh.[AN]
If you would let me, I'd even[N]

Lord Roy is certainly a[N]

[OpenMidRight]No, I don't.[AN]
Please tell it to me,[N]
Father Yoder.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a story of when Saint[N]

One day, during Saint Elimine's[N]
journeys,[AN]
an owl approached her from[N]
the forest.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The owl said to her,[AN]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.[N]
Would you show me the way?"[AN]
Saint Elimine thought for a[N]
moment, and replied,[AN]
"The gods' domain lies high[N]
above the clouds.[AN]
Your wings are not strong[N]
enough to take you there."[AN]
The owl, disappointed,[N]
returned to the forest.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Poor owl...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[AN]
We shall continue the[N]
story some other time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Some other time?[N]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember the teachings of[N]
Saint Elimine.[AN]
Do not try to understand things[N]
too quickly.[AN]
You must ponder on what you are told[N]
and develop your own thoughts.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Right.[AN]
Then please continue the story[N]

[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The eagle said to her,[AN]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.[N]
Would you show me the way?"[AN]
Saint Elimine thought for[N]
a moment, and replied,[AN]
"The gods' domain lies in a[N]
distant land beyond the night.[AN]
Your eyes will not be able[N]

The eagle, disappointed,[N]
returned to the mountain.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, the sympathetic and kind Saint[N]
Elimine could not ignore the two birds.[AN]
She went back, and brought the owl[N]
and eagle together.[AN]
She then told them,[N]
"Journey to the land of gods together."[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Together...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. The two birds traveled[N]
to the gods' land together.[AN]
The eagle used his powerful wings[N]
to carry the owl,[AN]

guide the eagle through the night.[AN]

are you all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[AN]
This is nothing.[N]
We are knights of Ilia.[AN]
We have more experience than[N]
the knights of any other nation.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I still have[N]
a lot to learn.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Humble. Good.[AN]
...Oh.[AN]
Noah, have you written[N]
your letter yet?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Letter?[N]
Oh... That letter.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Surely you remember what you[N]
were told when you first enlisted.[AN]
There are pegasus knight[N]
messengers that fly with us.[AN]
Should you fall in battle, they[N]
will deliver our letters for us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I remember.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither of us will have[N]
peaceful deaths.[AN]
We need those letters.[AN]
Noah, don't you have anyone[N]
to send that letter to?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...not really.[AN]
I do recall the others[N]
writing letters, though.[AN]
They addressed them to[N]
their parents...or lovers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You should do the same.[AN]
Why don't you get a[N]

It's you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Trec and I...[N]

[OpenMidRight]Speaking of those two...[N]
I wonder where they are now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I've no idea.[AN]
But I instructed them well.[N]
They won't die so easily.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that some people we used[N]
to work with were hired by Bern...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[AN]
But such is the life of a[N]
mercenary.[AN]
We give our blood and get[N]
money in return.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Commander Zelot,[N]
what do you think of that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of what?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Nobles from other nations say[N]
that Ilia sells death for a living.[AN]
They say that we're vultures.[N]
That we prey on blood and decaying flesh.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't bother me.[AN]
We both know that Ilia couldn't[N]
survive without war.[AN]
We give our own blood to[N]

## ZelotTheaSupportC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot, I'm sure you're[N]
aware, but my mission is complete.[AN]
Regardless, I wish to remain with[N]
this army.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Very well.[AN]
You know, fate works in[N]
strange ways.[AN]
We were hired by the Lycian Army,[N]
and you were hired by Etruria...[AN]
I never thought we would be[N]
fighting together.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is strange indeed.[AN]
Etruria didn't seem to view us highly,[N]
but Commander Klein was caring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The important thing is[N]
that you're safe...[AN]
Juno was pretty worried about[N]
you and Shanna, you know.[AN]
Knowing you, I knew you'd[N]
be all right.[AN]
But you know Juno.[N]
She's a worrier.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know that all[N]
too well.[AN]
Juno often spoiled[N]
Shanna and me.[AN]
The day we left was a[N]
hectic one indeed.[AN]
Juno fretted over us[N]
so much.[AN]

our clothes...[AN]

What were they like?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Juno never told you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No. All I know is that[N]
they were soldiers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our mother was a pegasus knight.[AN]
Our parents were killed together on the[N]
battlefield when we were young.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We had no other relatives to[N]
turn to...[AN]
So Juno became our mother when[N]
she was still a teenager...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It must have been difficult.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ordinary girls her age concern[N]
themselves with romance,[AN]
but Juno took on the role of[N]
mother.[AN]
She never complained, though...[AN]
She always looked after us...[N]
with a smile on her face.[AN]
That's why...[AN]
That's why I always wanted[N]
Juno to find happiness.[AN]

made a wonderful feast...[AN]
Oh, and Juno was very pleased with[N]
the gift from you and Shanna.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really...?[AN]
I actually didn't want[N]
to give it...[AN]
But Shanna never listens[N]
once she's made up her mind.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha...[N]
It was an interesting gift.[AN]
But...I want to apologize to Juno.[AN]
If only I...[AN]
If only our nation had more[N]
to give,[AN]
she could have had a proper,[N]
elegant wedding...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I doubt Juno feels that[N]
way at all.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think it's good to leave[N]
our newborn baby with someone else.[AN]
You should go back home so you can[N]
take care of her.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's all right.[AN]
I trust my friend to take[N]
excellent care of her.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But she needs her[N]
mother's love.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I fight precisely because[N]
I'm her mother.[AN]
I want her to grow up[N]
without war and conflict.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I think I've told you before,[AN]
but nowhere is safe until[N]
this war ends.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's certainly true...[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you stay with[N]
us after that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't think that's possible...[AN]
I'll need to lead the mercenary knights[N]
to more work opportunities as before.[AN]
We can't support ourselves otherwise.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But most of Ilia's land can[N]
grow food now.[AN]
With enough effort, we can[N]
produce enough food to get by...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That won't happen overnight.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I know, but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Besides, who can guarantee a good[N]
harvest every single year?[AN]
Were our crops to fail, how would[N]
we get money?[AN]
How would we survive the winter if[N]
we're not prepared for failure?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I must lead the mercenary knights to[N]
make money,[AN]
at least until we can support ourselves[N]
even after a bad harvest.[AN]
I'll leave Edessa to you, so keep doing[N]
what you can to cultivate the land.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I will...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have faith that there will come a time[N]
when Ilia will be self-sufficient.[AN]

Once I'd grabbed all the goodies[N]

There was a man, standing right[N]
in front of me.[AN]
And wouldn't you know, that[N]
man was--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]My father?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You got it. Lord Hector just[N]
stood there, staring at me.[AN]
He didn't seem angry[N]

You could tell he was important[N]
just by looking at him.[AN]

bags of loot over my shoulders.[AN]
Would he call the guards?[AN]
Would he cut me down right then[N]
and there?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]What happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]He suddenly burst out[N]
laughing, milady.[AN]

I was confused, so I turned and[N]
yelled at him,[AN]
"I'm getting away with your treasure![N]
You're not going to do anything?!"[AN]
A heavy voice responded. "Flee if you[N]
wish. You have earned the treasure.[AN]
But is that what you want in life?[N]
To live in fear in the shadows?"[AN][Clear]
I ran like a madman, milady. I fled[N]
from the castle, from his booming voice.[AN]
I didn't know what to do with myself,[N]
so I wandered around aimlessly all night.[AN]
At the break of dawn...I found myself[N]
back at the front of the castle.[AN][Clear]
And Lord Hector was there waiting[N]

would be that princess...[AN]

I also did some research on[N]
what kind of work they do...[AN]
And...now I understand...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information[N]
dangerous to their enemies.[AN]
If a spy is caught, the enemy[N]
will exploit any weakness.[AN]
Family and loved ones are[N]
often taken hostage...[AN]
And the spy is tortured until he[N]
spills every bit of information.[AN]
That's why a spy must be alone...[AN]
He must have no family, friends,[N]
or loved ones...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry, but...[N]
that guy is dead.[AN]
He was devoured by the[N]
quicksands of Nabata.[AN]

It's just your imagination.[AN]

you see things.[AN]

All I know is that they made contact[N]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]When Roy was studying in Ostia,[N]
you wouldn't teach him magic,[AN]
no matter how much he asked.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah... You're right.[N]
I didn't.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why not?[N]
You taught me so much.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's partly because of you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because of me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right.[AN]
Roy... You know how he is.[AN]
If I'd taught him magic, he would[N]
have practiced and practiced.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that sounds like him.[N]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, practice isn't enough to[N]
master a school of magic.[AN]
You need talent, and that can't[N]
be obtained through practice.[AN]
With another person of such talent[N]
so close to him, what would he think?[AN]
He'd work as hard--maybe even harder[N]
than her,[AN]
but he would still lag far behind.[AN]
What would that do to his confidence?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That person of talent...[N]
Do you mean me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Everyone has things they excel[N]
at naturally.[AN]
It was clear that Roy wouldn't[N]
excel at magic,[AN]
so I decided he would be better[N]
off learning the sword instead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Lilina, you will lead Ostia someday.[N]
You should remember this...[AN]
Assigning someone a task they do[N]

Or rather, he's more confident when[N]
he gives commands to the army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyone in charge of an army[N]
gains traits like that.[AN]
If Roy didn't grow, the army[N]
would be doomed.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, you said before[N]
that I would lead Ostia.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are Lord Hector's[N]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think I could be[N]

Even I didn't know what to do at[N]
first when I was made Mage General.[AN]
I was taken from Ostia and brought[N]
to Aquileia. It was overwhelming.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you succeeded[N]
because of your talent...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not what I'm getting at.[AN]
I've only made it so far thanks[N]
to Perceval and General Douglas.[AN]
Don't think that you'll have to[N]
do everything on your own.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even Roy isn't fighting alone.[AN]
He puts his faith in everyone[N]
around him.[AN]
That is another important[N]
attribute for someone in power.[AN]
The ability to depend on others[N]
when you need them.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I've been wanting[N]
to ask you.[AN]
Why did you not[N]
become a knight?[AN]
Why did you become[N]
a mercenary?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Heavy armor doesn't[N]
really suit me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That is simply because you don't[N]
train yourself hard enough.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But, I mean,[N]
I wasn't born with--[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This is a perfect opportunity.[N]
I shall train you every day.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barthe...[N]
This training is just...crazy.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll get used to it soon enough.[AN]
I do it every day.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't have the[N]
build that you do...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Was that a complaint[N]
I heard just now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Then keep quiet[N]
and train harder.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir...[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Whew...[AN]
I wonder if I'm any closer[N]
to Sir Barthe by now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe]Ogier.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa![AN]
Oh, Sir Barthe![N]
You scared me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are doing well.[N]
Excellent.[AN]
Your body has gotten[N]
used to the training.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel uncomfortable if[N]
I'm not working my body.[AN]
I'd hate to fail for lack[N]
of training.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[AN]
If you train yourself constantly,[N]
you will never tire in battle.[AN]
That holds true both for knights[N]
like me and mercenaries like you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Mercenaries like me?[AN]
But I thought you wanted[N]
to make me a knight.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I only said that to make you[N]
train harder.[AN]
I know your build can't[N]
handle heavy armor.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It encouraged you,[N]
didn't it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did it?[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, never.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then I won't ask you[N]

[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'm sorry, sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember our training, Gwendolyn![AN]
Remember how we sprint-marched[N]
over that mountain.[AN]
This is nothing compared[N]

[OpenMidRight]Uh...[AN]

I could improve in...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[AN]
You must critique[N]
yourself now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?[N]
Why do you look so discouraged?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I...I want you to[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Sorry?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't...want you to[N]

[OpenMidRight]Walking?[N]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]For us knights, it's tough to get[N]
back up if we fall to the ground.[AN]
We have to build strong legs to[N]
ensure that we never fall.[AN]

I can't let you get ahead of me,[AN]
so I thought I'd practice[N]
the basics, too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's good.[AN]
But it'll take a lot[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight]How are you doing,[N]

A strong knight can't[N]
complain.[AN]

be a powerful mercenary...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thank you, Ogier.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]F-for what?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Our competition has kept[N]
me working hard.[AN]
I'd have probably given up[N]
by now if not for you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I feel the same way.[AN]
I've been able to come[N]
so far thanks to you.[AN]

A small band of entertainers stopped[N]
by my village once when I was younger.[AN]
I went to watch them...and a little[N]

She tripped a few times, but I could[N]
tell she was trying really hard.[AN]

cheered me up.[AN]

It is good to see you again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[N]
I am glad to see you well.[AN]
It appears you've adjusted well[N]
to the position of commander.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I think I have.[AN]
Though I am one of the least[N]
experienced in the army...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From the way I see it, those[N]

[OpenMidRight]I hope so,[N]

of all this?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of what?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think[N]
about this army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Frankly, I feel more at home[N]
here than in the Etrurian army.[AN]
Perhaps it is because of[N]
General Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you feel,[N]
General Perceval?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't feel completely[N]
comfortable here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You don't?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I think what I seek from[N]
an army doesn't exist here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying you can't get[N]
used to this army?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, not quite.[AN]
It is simply that I am, and will[N]
always be, a knight of Etruria.[AN]

revolution in Etruria?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I understand Bern was pulling strings[N]
behind the scenes, but still...[AN]
I never could have imagined the court[N]
would divide so violently.[AN]
To tell the truth, it's still[N]
difficult for me to accept.[AN]
I...I never thought that greed ruled[N]
the minds of so many people...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria had not known war for[N]
a very long time.[AN]
Thus, blinded by peace, we paid no[N]
heed to the scheming traitors.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... A conflict would have broken[N]
out even without Bern's help.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Once this war is over, I will[N]
devote my life to rebuilding Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, General Perceval.[AN]
I am prepared to give my life for[N]
that cause as well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein, I want you to[N]
seek a different path.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Once I return to Etruria, I plan to[N]
dismiss all but a few.[AN]
The few I have absolute trust in[N]
to stay loyal to the king and country.[AN]
It is what must be done to maintain trust[N]
among the king's vassals.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]General Perceval...[N]
Don't be ridiculous![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Klein...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please, think on it a[N]
little more.[AN][ToggleSmile]

to go to such extreme measures.[AN]

we are at war, but I will no longer.[AN]

I want to protect those I hold dear[N]

That's the power I seek.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This power...[N]
It's not to be taken lightly.[AN]
It can turn the whole planet[N]

I no longer feel alienated in[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Of course...[N]
It is my pleasure.[AN]
Tryffin, your master is[N]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a[N]

I'm sure she never wanted to[N]
turn her back on Bern...[AN]
I dragged her along with me...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I hear that Bern's training instills[N]
absolute loyalty in its troops.[AN]
Both in the knights, and in[N]
the mounts.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, definitely.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is so, why do you think[N]
Tryffin follows you against Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There are other wyvern riders of[N]
Bern in the enemy ranks we fight.[AN]
There are even high-ranking[N]
commanders and generals.[AN]
If this wyvern only followed the army's[N]
commands, she would not have stayed.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand[N]
what that means?[AN]
This wyvern has a will of[N]
her own.[AN]

Can you at least assure me that your[N]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You already have so much wealth...[N]
Why is that so unreasonable?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Attacks can be ordered[N]
even without the king.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria is a large nation governed by[N]
various families of nobility.[AN]
Not all nobles are kind at heart.[AN]
If such nobles took over the court,[N]
there is nothing the king or I could do.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But what is there to gain[N]
from a desert like Nabata?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not about gold for such people...[N]

stepping upon another.[AN]
