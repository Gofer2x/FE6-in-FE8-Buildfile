[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter, Marcus?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're not good.
Not good at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's not good?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The young recruits. Their combat
skills leave much to be desired.[A]
Granted, not all of them are
disappointments, but most are soft![A]
What they need is a more intense
training regimen...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't know if I'd call anyone
soft... Everyone's working hard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My Lord Roy, you are far
too easy on them.[A]
I shall go and teach them
how we used to do things![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Just don't work yourself
too hard.[A]
You're not as...well, youthful
as you used to be.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nonsense![A]
I may be getting on in years, but I'm
still more than a match for the youth![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
If you think more training is
what they need, then go ahead.[A]
Just take care not to overwork
yourself. Age can be cruel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, my lord.
Thank you for your concern.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Roy is such a caring and
thoughtful young master...[A]
The other youths we have can't
even compare... It's a disgrace![A]
I'm the only one who can serve
our Lord Roy properly.[A]

Lord Roy, I believe training needs
to be made more difficult.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]More difficult?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, my lord.[A]
And those who fail to perform
up to par should be discharged.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
Such rules may make our numbers small,
but we will be an army of elites.[A]
That would increase our combat
efficiency several times over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Marcus.
I don't think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
Why not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who's to judge whether someone
is performing up to par?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Why, you, naturally,
Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But some soldiers may excel
while I'm not looking.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes...
Well, in that case...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
We also have people supporting
us off the battlefield,[A]
and yet more who simply haven't
yet had a chance to shine.[A]
I couldn't discharge such
soldiers.[A]
Many have joined us thanks to
their belief in our fight.[A]
I can't simply tell them
to leave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
Marcus, try to trust them.
We're all working together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You are right.[A]
I was mistaken, Lord Roy.
Your ideas are noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's strange to hear
you praise me.[A]
I'm more used to hearing
you scold me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. But thank
you, Marcus.[A][ClearFace]

You seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What are you
worried about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I was just thinking about
how to move our troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How to move the troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The enemy grows stronger all the time
so strategies quickly become obsolete.[A]
I was wondering how to effectively
break through their defensive lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's easy, Lord Roy!
Just allow me to charge in.[A]
I will shatter their shields
and pierce their armor![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thanks for the offer, but I don't
want to put you in danger.[A]
There must be another way...
I'll think on it some more.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, I have an idea of how to
break through the enemy's defenses...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]An idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We leave our best troops behind, and send
the weaker ones to the front lines.[A]
Once the enemies are weakened, the stronger
troops will be able to finish them.[A]
Please, allow me to be in the front lines
with the other weaker soldiers![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But then we would risk losing you
and everyone you're with...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We might suffer some casualties,
but we will win the battle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Alen, I can't
use that idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-why not, milord?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can't use a strategy that I
know will cause casualties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But Lord Roy, casualties
are unavoidable in war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think not.[A]
It may be naive to say so, but a victory
with casualties is no victory at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You want a complete victory...
Is that possible in war?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think it is.
We need another plan.[A]

I think you should stay

Wait.[A]
I have no right to order others if
I prioritize my safety above all else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true![A]

I have to gain everyone's trust by

None would give their life for

Of course.[A]
If you will allow me one
piece of advice,[A]

stay true to your heart.[A]

My feelings don't align with what

And when I start feeling frustrated,

It is bad for your health to

Roy...I'm sorry
about before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was reminiscing about before
the war.[A]
It's all changed... I need to accept
that nothing will ever be the same...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, some things will
never change.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Like us. We'll always
be together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We can't go back to the past, but we're
the ones who will build the future.[A]
We'll make the future as good as--no,
better than the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's you. Talking like that.
Are you trying to charm me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
W-was it that obvious?[A]
Yeah, I guess it was a

You've become a true leader.[A]

In a way, he was isolated.[A]

You and Lord Roy are the same age, and
what's more, you were raised together.[A]
I need you to stay by Lord Roy's

But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know much of these matters,[A]

women can no longer be passive.[A]
I'm certain Lord Roy would fall

more difficult from here on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, but a challenge
is just what I want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have something to
request of you. If we lose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If we lose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
...If it ever looks like defeat is certain,
I want you to take Lord Roy and retreat.[A]
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy you time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
But what about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]If it has to be one of us,
it may as well be me.[A]
I've served House Pherae the
shortest, so--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you lost your mind?![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you're staying, then so will I.[A]
I won't allow you to run headfirst
into certain death alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of a long line of
knights serving House Pherae.[A]
It's better that you take
Lord Roy and flee.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long you've served means nothing!
Let me ask you this.[A]
Do you consider yourself any less
loyal than the other knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]No answer? Then allow me.[A]
You're just as valuable as any of us![A]
You've held to your knightly

I've been your partner ever since you
came to House Pherae so I know that well![A]

[OpenMidRight]No, you're right.
Your words were a slap in the face.[A]
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've served House Pherae the shortest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.[A]
Well, second to mine,
but that's a given.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?
I envy you sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm confident simply because I know
I could never lose to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'll make you eat those words
after I beat you today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hah, not likely![A]
See you after the battle![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, the point is, you should
fight more cautiously.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand your concern.
But I can't hold back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if you keep fighting
like that, you'll--[A]
[OpenMidRight]In battle, the first to match blades
with the enemy are us. The knights.[A]
The enemy will judge the entire army
by looking at how we fight.[A]
That's why I have to show them my
full power.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The slightest recoil will signal to
the enemy that we can be defeated.[A]
And what's more, my fellow knights
will see and may hesitate...[A]
That's why I charge ahead.[A]
I have to keep pushing forward.
For the army. For victory.[A]

You have a worried look about you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I was just thinking
about something.[A]
Actually, this is perfect. Let me
ask your opinion on something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is within my meager
scope of knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, so, axes are
weak against swords.[A]
That much is common sense.[A]
What I'm wondering is why it's
that way to begin with.[A]
I don't understand the
physics behind it.[A]
That's what's troubling me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. I wondered the same
thing before.[A]
I found the answer after going
through several books on tactics.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it...the
weapon's weight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
All weapons are designed by
humans.[A]
As such, an invincible weapon
with no flaws is inconceivable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying a weapon will
always have weaknesses.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
Throughout history, many kinds of
weapons have been made,[A]
and the vast majority of them 
have fallen out of use.[A]
Of all of them, the sword, axe and lance
remain, creating the weapon triangle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what about weapons like
the swordreaver?[A]

I've always fought like this.
On my feet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Isn't it hard to fight

[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think it's better to
fight on horseback.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
...You mean with a bow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and retreat from your target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, to each their own...[A]
Wait, did you try getting off your
horse and shooting from the ground?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I wanted to try it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have hurt yourself![A]
You can't try new ways of fighting
like that during a battle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it wasn't in battle.[A]
I just shot at some

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You tried it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought I may as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What did you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well, a horse's speed
is unbeatable.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said it was dangerous to try
new ways of fighting in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh, I did, didn't I?[A]
I only tried it for a bit.
It's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want the advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well, though...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shoot? I don't think I'd be able

changed as much as you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He has certainly matured, but his

a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There were many tough battles in
our journey from Lycia to Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, it's not as if I was just
sitting around in Ostia, either.[A]
I trained at the arena,
preparing for battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I remember that arena.[A]
I have to say, though...
I don't really approve of that.[A]
A knight, fighting for money?
It's almost a contradiction...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Not going into battle
alongside Lord Hector.[A]
You've always said that a
knight's purpose is to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I would certainly say I was
disappointed at first.[A]
But staying and protecting the castle
and Lady Lilina was its own battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's for sure...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I allowed Lady Lilina to fall
into the hands of the enemy.[A]
That was my failure.
I was naive...[A]
Somewhere in my heart, I wanted
to believe that Ostia was secure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't blame yourself...
You always do that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's true. I do...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Why did you become
a knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because I want to protect
the ones I love.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Admirable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I became a knight because they
are the strongest fighters.[A]
I don't believe any can match a
knight in a one-on-one battle.[A]
...That's why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina...[A]
We faced a whole army of armored
knights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Blaming yourself again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It only happened because I
wasn't strong enough.[A]
If I had enough power to stop
the rebellion myself,[A]
I could have contained the
situation.[A]
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Then become a lance
sharper than any other.[A]
And I shall be your
impervious shield.[A]

unbreakable shield.[A]

[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
The battle with Sir Barthe was so
boring that you forgot about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, no, nothing of that sort.[A]

I got the medicine and cloth
you asked for from Merlinus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you. Could you leave
them there, please?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here?[A]
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you an assistant
to the transporter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I fight as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
A child like you...
in battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I may be a kid, but I'm
pretty handy with my magic![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I don't doubt your ability...[A]
It's just...children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm only about two years
younger than Lord Roy, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...has no choice
but to be here.[A]
That is not the case
for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I have no choice, either.
I must fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks for the concern,
but I'm fine.[A]
Actually, there's someplace
I need to be right now.[A]
See you later, Sister![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're the cleric
from before![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My name is Elen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And I am Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really do fight
on the battlefield...[A]
Are you all right?
You're not injured?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
I may be small,
but I'm pretty fast.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh...[A]
I'm still uneasy about allowing such
a small child into battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I look so small?[A]
But if that's how you want to
play it,[A]
then isn't it just as dangerous to
send a frail lady like you into battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That...may be true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yep![A]
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll come to your rescue.[A]
You can count on me![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, Lugh.[A]

anything rash.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I thought I saw an
enemy near you...[A]
Huff, huff...[A][......]
[ToggleSmile]But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were looking out for me?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course!
I said I would protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have such a kind heart...[A]
I am sure the gods look
favorably upon you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...That smile makes you look
like a goddess![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A goddess?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Actually, I was worried about you
because you always looked so pensive.[A]
Not that I can really blame you
given the war and all...[A]
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that![A]

your smile too, Lugh.[A]

## ElenSaulSupportC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Are you Brother Saul?[A]
I am Elen, a cleric of the
St. Elimine Church in Bern.[A]
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dear gods, I thank you
for your blessing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um... Brother Saul?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly, being able to meet such a beautiful
lady is a blessing from the gods![A]
And you are a follower of the
St. Elimine Church, no less![A]
This meeting must have been part of
some divine plan.[A]
Please, let us meet this evening so that
we can discuss the love of the gods.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to.
What time can you meet?[A]
I am free all night...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am always serious
about the gods.[A]
Why would I refuse?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Satisfaction?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please, never you mind.
But Elen, are you sure?[A]
With a woman like you, I may lose
control, and...do things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not worried.
You are a priest.[A]
I'm sure you would
never do such a thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Er...
I'm sorry.[A]
Perhaps some
other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I was looking
forward to it...[A]

## ElenSaulSupportB
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Why, hello, Elen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good day, Brother Saul.
It is good to see you well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You are so tense, so stressed!
You must relax your muscles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Absolutely. Those in service to the gods
must learn to unwind once in a while.[A]
You should enjoy the finer things in
life at times, as I do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I once knew a lady like you...[A]
Well, not "knew" so much as
"was slapped by", but...[A]
If you serve the gods, you must
experience all of their creation.[A]
You can experience things that will
open your eyes...[A]
Things that you will not believe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh my, yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Life is all about the
experiences we can have.[A]
Shall we discuss meeting
this evening again?[A]
I am free at any time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That would be marvelous.
I would love to hear you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Excellent. Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall invite the
others as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?
The others?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes. If you will preach, then let
us help as many as we can.[A]
I'll ask Lord Roy, Merlinus, and any
others who are interested.[A]
I'm sure some of them will be
free tonight.[A][ClearFace]

## ElenSaulSupportA
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Brother Saul... Why didn't
you come that night?[A]
Everyone was so looking
forward to your sermon...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, er... My throat
was unwell that day.[A]
We can try again some
other time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, let's.[A][Clear]
Brother Saul, you are
so selfless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Selfless?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes. You appear to be an
impious womanizer.[A]
Hardly someone I would call
a priest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there is
a reason for that.[A]
It is a character act.[A]
It is to show that the St. Elimine
Church accepts even the lowest of men.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[A]
I, uh... Hmm. OK.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting as you do ruins your
reputation and image...[A]
Everyone thinks you're lazy and
only interested in women...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But the truth is that you do it for
the church.[A]
I could not sacrifice myself as you do.
You have my respect, Brother Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er... Thanks. I think.[A]
Well, anyway, just remember to
relax once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Brother Saul.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Oh, if you're going up front,
please take these vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You seem to be more...

[OpenMidLeft]If you have something to say,
then I will listen.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I can't force you...[A]
But as we both serve
Princess Guinivere,[A]
I would appreciate if
you voiced any concerns.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, well, I suppose I can

[OpenMidLeft]Before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said that I
seemed concerned...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A][ToggleSmile]
Are you ready to tell me
what's on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. Uh...[A]
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Apologize?
For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]When the princess and I left to
meet with the Lycian lords,[A]
I didn't consult you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I wanted to apologize for that...[A]
I know you have nothing but loyalty
for Princess Guinivere, yet I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You just followed Princess Guinivere's
orders, as is your duty.[A]
You have nothing to apologize for.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Elen, you always doubt your
actions too much.[A]
You won't be able to move forward
if your mind is stuck in the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[A]

## ElenMeladySupportA
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Elen, you look
a lot better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I feel a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.[A]
Thank you again for listening
to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Any time at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...our roles are reversed...[A]
I am the cleric.[A]
It is I who am supposed to listen to
others to relieve them of their problems,[A]
and yet it is you who helped me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen, I told you not to 
doubt your actions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm actually grateful you didn't tell
me when you left with the princess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grateful...?
You are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
You kept Princess Guinivere
safe even without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Madam Melady...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Together I'm sure we can be of
great help to Princess Guinivere.[A]
Just don't worry so much about
trivial matters anymore, all right?[A]

You are with this army as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will always be at

Did you join to help

[OpenMidRight]That's part of it, of course,[A]

[OpenMidLeft]So you will be assisting

Oh, him?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Elen, he's in
our army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh dear...
How very embarrassing...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you scream or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'm afraid so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're still scared of men?[A]
I remember it was years before you
would speak to me normally like this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
That's just how you are.[A]
But you don't need to
address me as "Sir".[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Why are you always...
so kind to me...?[A]

I feel that I can't...
leave you alone, you know?[A][ToggleSmile]
I want to stay by your side

Do you not want me to?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm very glad...[A]

Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
I'm a knight of Bern, so I'll
protect the princess, too.[A][ToggleSmile]

Sure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pay more attention to what's

The way you fight, you're just
asking to be killed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Aw, c'mon, Big Man, I haven't

I can crush anything with

Uhh...[A][Clear]

[OpenMidLeft]No![A]
I told you to pay more attention

[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since then, I've been
following your advice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that.
You're still alive.[A]
If you pay more attention, you

With your strength, you can impress

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, he is.[A]
But...he's young.
Too young.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand why you like him.[A]
He's a nice kid, and he's got
brains and guts.[A]
But...these battles are all

When we get to a real battle, and
he's in a life or death situation...[A]

## DieckLotSupportB
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x115][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Years ago...when I first

All I cared about was
making a name for myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really...?
I wouldn't have expected that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our squad was sent right behind
enemy lines.[A]
Our mission was to go deep into
Bern and finish the enemy leader.[A]
We waited in a cave for days...
and then the time came.[A]
When we moved out...arrows
rained down on us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our employer...[A]
He had put us there so he could
buy time for himself and escape.[A]
Our squad was decimated.
They killed everyone.[A]
Except for me, of course.
They tortured me for information.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We mercenaries are expendable

[OpenMidLeft]What is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're mercenaries.[A]
We shouldn't care who wins. We fight
for money and self-preservation.[A]
We're better off walking away from
a tough fight than staying.[A]
But...it's different now.[A]
We've been through so many tough
battles, and still, here I am.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]I want you to slow down to

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
But I do fine on my own![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It worries us when you go
charging in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But if I get stronger...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can you stand up to a
whole army on your own?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, no.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then match your pace with the
others and work as a team.[A]
That'll maximize our chance

[OpenMidRight]That'll help us win, huh?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What I said then
applies to soldiers.[A]
What I'm saying now
applies to sellswords.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To sellswords...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A sellsword has to fend for
him or herself.[A]
No one's gonna watch
your back.[A]
Always question others.
You should even question me.[A]
Question whether my orders
serve the group,[A]
or if they're just putting you in
harm's way to protect myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't think that's
necessary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would never make

[OpenMidLeft]You can never be sure.[A]

I didn't look Sacaen.[A]

But you do have Sacaen blood

[OpenMidLeft]Yes. My father's mother and my

Bulgar is near Bern's border, so many
people of mixed blood lived there.[A]
Usually the Sacaen blood shows itself
more prominently.[A]
But...[A]
But I was different. I appear to be
of Bern, so I was left alive...[A]

It was 15 years ago, at Aquileia's
greatest arena.[A]
A noble's child was attacked by a
lion in the opening display.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]A young arena combatant was the one
who saved the child.[A]
He was a skilled swordfighter who could
defeat men twice his size with ease.[A]
But fighting a lion isn't the same.
He didn't leave the fight unscathed.[A]
He left with wounds all over his body
and four deep scars on his face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The noble, impressed and moved by
the swordsman's selfless act,[A]
hired him into his family's service
and treated him well.[A]
For several years, the young man served
as the family's personal arena fighter.[A]
His name became known all across
the land.[A]
But one day, he decided to give up
that life and left.[A]
The child, who looked up to the
fighter as if he were a brother,[A]
felt betrayed, and was devastated.[A]
...But now I understand.[A]
You were doing what you felt was best
for me and my family...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...you were much too kind to me.
I was but a lowly fighter.[A]
Lord Pent and Lady Louise treated
me like family. Like a son.[A]
Gossip and accusations spread
about them.[A]
...That's why I left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that now.
But you should have stayed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You always wanted what was best
for us...[A]
But did you ever consider how much
we cared about you?[A]
I can't just forget about you...[A]

considered that. I'm sorry.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]But you're still
in training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just remember that you can never
be overly cautious in battle.[A]
Staying wary will keep you alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, yeah.[A]

charge in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No buts.
You should be more--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why are you always so
concerned about me?[A]
Oh wait, I get it.[A][Clear]
Aww, I never knew you felt
that way about me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have a little sister back home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A sister?[A]
Does she look like
me or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not in the slightest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's a lot younger than you.
She isn't even ten years old.[A]
That's why I worry like I do,
fighting in battles like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Shanna, you have an
older sister, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, two actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then take care of yourself.
If not for your sake, then for them.[A]
Imagine how they'd feel if
something happened to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... You're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]

well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm being more careful now.
I don't rush in anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, not as much as
before, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, that means I can still
improve, doesn't it...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something
I wanted to tell you, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
A tip for battle!
Do you want to hear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear
for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK...
Like this?[A]

Don't stress yourself

Western Isles, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Easy. Your face.[A]
All men from the Isles
have features like yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...They do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back home
after the war?[A]
If you are, I could
use your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.[A]
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.[A]
I want you to help build it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, I'll do
what I can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't make any
promises.[A]
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Talking like that already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I only say it because it's
a distinct possibility.[A]
I'm not one to make empty
promises...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You sure worry a lot for
someone your age.[A]
You'll be getting gray hairs
before thirty at that rate.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, it's you again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the one who wanted
to build the village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The planning's going
along smoothly.[A]
A free village,
open to anybody...[A]
It's like a dream
coming true.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have the money
to build it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You want logistics now, eh?[A]
To tell the truth... No.[A]
But there are mines in the Isles,[A]
so I just need to go in and find
the mother lode.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That seems pretty unlikely...[A]
...Oh, wait.[A]
I know of an old, deserted
gold mine you could try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I went there with my
friend Ward when I was a kid.[A]
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Go on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ward was really scared.
He probably believed the rumors.[A]
We went in a ways, and Ward let out
a scream and ran for the entrance.[A]
So I followed him out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did he see something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, snakes.[A]
Tons of them.[A]
They covered the whole
cave floor.[A]
What I want to know is how they
got there in the first place...[A]
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see... So there might still
be some gold left in there.[A]
Sounds interesting.[A]
We might get enough money for
the village there.[A]
Say, can you take me when
you get the chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm not worried.[A]
You'll be there to protect us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Still alive, at least.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you die.
I need you to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.[A]
And there's also...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing. Never mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[A]
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?[A]
Well, well, aren't you a
lucky guy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I want to go home as soon as
I can, provided I'm alive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about
that again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemies get stronger
all the time.[A]
I don't know how much
longer I'll last.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm confident that we'll win
in the end...[A]
But I just don't know
that I'll make it home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on, don't
be stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone your age should be
enjoying life![A]
I know you have your sister
to think of.[A]
But let yourself go once
in a while.[A]
You might get a few cuts
and bruises, but that's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't like cuts
and bruises.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. If you die,
I'll take care of things.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So go out and get killed!
It'll be fine.[A]
...Trust me.[A][ClearFace]

Don't be mean.
Come on, tell me![A]

Very well, I suppose...[A]

in Etruria.[A]
Juno's pegasus squad was
hired by our enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We decided to settle the dispute
peacefully through diplomacy.[A]
Juno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.[A]
We got to know each other,
and it progressed after that.[A]

Are there any men you

[OpenMidRight]What are you planning to do

[OpenMidRight]I'll go see the children.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Then I'll go with you.[A]

You must do my bidding.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Maybe. Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to borrow 3,000 gold.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you're out of luck, kid.[A]
I only lend money to grown-ups.
Especially to lovely ladies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh.[A]
All right, I'll ask

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey, hey,

Have a little more
persistence, kid.[A]
You can't give up
so easily.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you only lend money
to adults, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you insist, I can
make an exception for you.[A]
But your interest will be
twice the normal rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought you'd say
something like that.[A]
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.[A]
I'll give it back when
we get paid.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4,000.[A]
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I keep my promises.
What kind of person doesn't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'd be surprised.[A]
You're an honest kid. You sure
you chose the right career?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop calling me "kid".
My name is Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, Chad.[A]
So tell me, why'd you
become a thief?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Stealing's the only way
I could live. I'm an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you live alone?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I lived in a small orphanage
in Lycia near the border to Bern.[A]
I grew up with other orphans.[A]
We did pretty well. Poppa and
the other kids and me...[A]
...If this war hadn't broken
out, I'd still be there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Poppa was a good man,[A]
but he could only keep the orphanage
running through charity.[A]
After the war started we began
to run low on food and clothes.[A]
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.[A]
So the only way to get food was
to steal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then I'm guessing you sent that
3,000 gold to the orphanage...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
...The orphanage isn't
there anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Poppa was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]W-what about the children?
Were they spared?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks to Poppa, yeah.
None of us were hurt.[A]
The children are with the
St. Elimine Church now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I used the money to buy a
strong sword.[A]
I'm going to use it to end
this war quickly.[A]
Then I can go back to the
children![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So the kids are family to you.
You want to protect them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right.
I've got nothing else.[A]
You got a problem
with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not at all...[A]
I'm sorry I was so rude
with you before.[A]
You've already grown up, Chad.[A]
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.[A]

Have you been doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I guess.
But not as well as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Man, are you always
such a downer?[A]
Can't you be more like,[A][ToggleSmile]
"Hey, Hugh! What's up?"
And smile for a change.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I think I'd vomit if
I tried to do that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aw, come on![A]
Your story really made me
think. I want to help you![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you really a mage, old man?[A]
You seem more like some kind of
jester or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]O-old man!?[A]
Does this handsome face look
like it belongs to an "old man"?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. Well, compared
to mine, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh!
Daggers through my heart![A]
...I take personal offense
to "old man".[A]
Seriously, you can call me
anything.[A]
Smelly, messy, stupid, anything.
Just don't call me "old man"![A]
I feel like my soul has died

Ha ha...huff... My...my stomach...!
Ha ha ha...![A]

[OpenMidRight]Oh man, that reaction was
priceless.[A]
I really pressed your buttons
with that, didn't I?[A]
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
You're OK with that, aren't you?[A]
Since you claim you're not
an old man.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you are capable of
laughing after all![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've always got that
glare in your eyes.[A]
Your brow is always
furrowed like you're mad.[A]
And you're rude, you
have an attitude,[A]
and you never smile.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry, what are you
talking about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen so many kids lose the
ability to laugh thanks to this war.[A]
Grown-ups have a lot of issues,
but come on, kids have to laugh.[A]
Even if the idiots who start these
wars don't think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]If there are still kids who can laugh,
then maybe there is hope after all.[A]
I know you've had it rough, but you
have to laugh once in a while, OK?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha, sorry!
I'll see you later.[A]
Just don't screw up![A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm glad you're speaking

[OpenMidLeft]I didn't want things to
end like that.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to
my story?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four,[A]
and ever since then I'd been
living at an orphanage in Lycia.[A]
It was tiny, with only seven kids and
one priest who we all called Poppa.[A]
The oldest kids were Chad and my twin
brother Raigh and I,[A]
so we three took care of the younger
children.[A]
We were poor, but we were happy
anyway.[A]
But after Bern started this war,
our lives began to change.[A]
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...[A]
Chad... He started stealing food
without telling Poppa...[A]
Raigh got fed up with that lifestyle
and left one day without a word.[A]
I hated Bern... We all did.[A]
Bern was responsible for everything...
Bern killed Poppa...[A]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[A]
..Anger motivates better
than sorrow...[A]
Anger has kept me alive...[A]
So that I can protect the
children...[A][Clear]
...Sigh...[A]
So...for now, at least until
the war ends...[A]
I have to stay angry at Bern.[A][Clear]
...But you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...[A]
Do I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It would make me so happy if

it would be wasted on me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of that now!
I am offering it to you.[A]
Please, take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh... Well, thank you,

[OpenMidLeft]Additionally...you must change

Absolutely not. I did not make her cry.
She is the one who chose to cry.[A]

Never again to see the outside world,
concerned only with decorating myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that is how most
Etrurian ladies are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know...[A]
But being the most elegant in Etruria
does not seem as appealing as it once did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's because you're growing and
maturing, Clarine.[A]
If you stay at the manse, you could
live your life without any worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But it would be so
horribly boring![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed...
All right, here's what we will do.[A]
Once this war is over, we will first
let Mother and Father know we are safe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]

I've always left you out of it.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, er, um...
Th-that was just...[A]

might you be interested in having
dinner with me some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
I don't serve the gods

Your beauty is so overwhelming.
It is an honor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, more or less.[A]
But my only goal is to make
you feel at ease around me...[A][Clear]
Ah, yes![A]
We must decide on a date for
our dinner meeting.[A]
Have you thought about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dinner?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Th-this cannot be!
You've forgotten?[A]
We agreed that we all serve the

recall vaguely...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Vaguely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I see.[A]

about our dinner meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I will invite you to my
manor when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will look forward to that![A]
It is not every day that one is invited
to the manor of an Etrurian noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be...[A]
a little difficult.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Difficult?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.[A]
However, one time, when I
was still a child,[A]
I invited a male friend of
mine to the manor.[A]
When my father saw him, he drew
his sword and threatened his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
I would call that more
than "difficult".[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father lost his temper,
and we tried to calm him down.[A]
But he would have none of it.[A]
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,[A]
and what was supposed to be a dinner
party was more like an arena battle.[A]
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.[A]
I will never forget that day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]But my father isn't that bad
compared to my grandfather...[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, there is no need

What is it that you need?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you know of the St. Elimine
Church, Igrene?[A]
It is very popular among
the nobility,[A]
because when one prays deeply,
all of one's dreams come true![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh... That's what
you want...[A]
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in the gods...[A]

the church, you will be cursed![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...The gods you follow
would do that?[A]

Saint Elimine must have
guided you towards me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think so.
I'll be going now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, please wait![A]
It is a wonderful thing
to believe, Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]I know. I believed in
gods once.[A]
Different from yours,
though.[A]
I was quite devout.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
Why did you stop believing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Several years ago...
I stopped praying.[A]
It was after I lost a
loved one in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those who pray to the gods expect
something in return.[A]
But when they receive nothing,
they cease to believe they exist.[A]
I think it's less trouble to
never believe in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yes...
You may be right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Should a priest like you
really be saying that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, it's fine.
I am an open-minded person.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However, Saint Elimine
did say this:[A]
"When the gods don't help us,
it is because they believe in us."[A]
[OpenMidRight]They...believe in us?[A]

before...[A]
You said when the gods don't help
us it's because they believe in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is what Saint Elimine said.[A]
The gods who created this world are
all-powerful.[A]
They can change people and the world.[A]
They can make humans docile so that
we don't fight as we do now.[A]
But what would that achieve?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Humans manipulated by the gods are
nothing more than mindless puppets.[A]
The gods believe that humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.[A]
The gods know that we can overcome
our hardships to achieve peace.[A]

We get more followers every

[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes. As I notified you
in my letter,[A]
Lord Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Has there been anything
else worth noting?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not particularly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
I am sorry to put you
through all this, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, please don't be.[A]
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.
That warms my heart to hear.[A]
...Oh, Saul. I have received
a complaint from Sir Merlinus.[A]
Apparently you stalk Princess
Guinivere wherever she goes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Father Yoder.
That is my mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul, your mission is to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.[A]
And you already told me that it
is now in the hands of Lord Roy.[A]
Not Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, well, be that as it may,
consider this, Father Yoder.[A]
I can't follow Lord Roy wherever
he goes just because he has the Emblem.[A]
His appearance ill suits my tastes.
I cannot justify it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]What do you mean,
Father Yoder?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I know Lord Roy
well enough to trust him.[A]
The Fire Emblem is safe
in his hands.[A]
What we feared will surely
not come to pass.[A]
Do you agree?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are probably right.[A]
...However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, I understand your
reasoning, Father Yoder.[A]
Lord Roy is certainly a
trustworthy person.[A]
Still...Lord Roy is young, and needs
people to guide him through this vile world.[A]
Who better than one such as I, with so
much experience in such ugliness?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er... All that said, I too am pure, so
disregard my declaration if you wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think I will.[A]

I found this pamphlet
the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
This is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]"All wounds treated freely for members
of the church. Sign up today!"[A]

One day, during Saint Elimine's

an owl approached her from
the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The owl said to her,[A]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"[A]
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and replied,[A]
"The gods' domain lies high
above the clouds.[A]
Your wings are not strong
enough to take you there."[A]
The owl, disappointed,
returned to the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Poor owl...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A]
We shall continue the
story some other time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Some other time?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember the teachings of
Saint Elimine.[A]
Do not try to understand things
too quickly.[A]
You must ponder on what you are told
and develop your own thoughts.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]The eagle said to her,[A]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"[A]
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and replied,[A]
"The gods' domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.[A]
Your eyes will not be able
to guide you through the dark."[A]

She then told them,
"Journey to the land of gods together."[A]
[OpenMidRight]Together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. The two birds traveled
to the gods' land together.[A]
The eagle used his powerful wings

I must be up front to fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will do the fighting.
You must remain safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My archery skills are much
better than they once were.[A]
I'm sure I can be of help
to the army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have orders from the
Silver Wolf to keep you safe.[A]
I will not allow you to put
yourself in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Very well.
Then I will do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sound like Grandfather

Sue, you're still up

[OpenMidLeft]I understand your concern, but I can't
sit around doing nothing, either.[A]

You are the clan's

The nations in the west, Lycia

were very different from Sacae.[A]
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would allow no arrows to pass.[A]

So I would imagine.[A]
In the vast plains of Sacae, horses
are our livelihood.[A]
But in more populated areas,[A]
key points are defended by soldiers

It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Betrayal and trickery are

I think you have been especially
blessed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The land isn't as it used to be.[A]
We of Sacae must have broader
perspectives.[A]
We must think outside of
the clans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Chieftain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You seem to have learned much
in your travels.[A]
This old wolf is too old to
learn new ways of thinking.[A]
But you are young.[A]
You are responsible for leading
Sacae to a brighter future.[A]

money in return.[A]

what do you think of that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.[A]
They say that we're vultures.
That we prey on blood and decaying flesh.[A]

We were hired by the Lycian Army,

Something wrong, Noah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I was just thinking
some things over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thinking things over?
Don't bother.[A]
Humans aren't meant to think
deeply like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.[A]
But you know, this war...[A]
I mean, I never wanted to go out
and save the world or anything,[A]
but look how many battles we've
been through.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But no matter what we've done,
Ilia's still the same.[A]
Our children, and our children's
children...[A]
They'll be peddling death to
make a living, just like we do.[A]
I was just wondering...
Can't we do anything about that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Maybe it's useless for us
to try and make a difference...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well... It doesn't really
matter, does it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I mean, everyone goes through hard times.
Isn't that just part of life?[A]

made me think...[A]
Do you have any loved

I think I'm pretty normal.[A]
Everyone always tells me
I look so carefree.[A]
But I have concerns too,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the other day
I dreamed I was a horse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A horse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think this dream has some kind

I wrote,[A]
I remember all the kinds of

Is it because you don't want

You haven't changed at all.[A]
My father always said you'd be better

[OpenMidRight]...By the way, how did you
meet my father?[A]
He never told me anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It really wasn't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was a petty thief back then.[A]
I decided to creep into Castle Ostia

[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]

## AstolfoLilinaSupportB
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]...It was easy getting to
the treasure vault.[A]
I'm an expert at picking locks
and all that, after all.[A]
Once I'd grabbed all the goodies
and made my way out, bam![A]
There was a man, standing right
in front of me.[A]
And wouldn't you know, that
man was--[A]
[OpenMidRight]My father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You got it. Lord Hector just
stood there, staring at me.[A]
He didn't seem angry
or anything.[A]
You could tell he was important
just by looking at him.[A]
Me? I was frozen on the spot, with
bags of loot over my shoulders.[A]
Would he call the guards?[A]
Would he cut me down right then
and there?[A]
My mind was racing, trying to
figure out what was coming up...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He suddenly burst out
laughing, milady.[A]
"Quite a man to get through my
security so easily," he said.[A]
Then he asked my name. I was
speechless, mouth open.[A]
Lord Hector then offered me
the job of serving him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought he was out of his mind.
But I could tell he was serious.[A]
Anyway, I wasn't up for it and ran
for the door with the treasure.[A]
And then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And then Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What did he do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He...[A]

He didn't budge even when he
saw me start to run.[A]
So I made a mad dash.[A]
I was almost at the door, but Lord
Hector was still just standing there.[A]
I was confused, so I turned and
yelled at him,[A]
"I'm getting away with your treasure!
You're not going to do anything?!"[A]
A heavy voice responded. "Flee if you
wish. You have earned the treasure.[A]
But is that what you want in life?
To live in fear in the shadows?"[A][Clear]
I ran like a madman, milady. I fled
from the castle, from his booming voice.[A]
I didn't know what to do with myself,
so I wandered around aimlessly all night.[A]
At the break of dawn...I found myself
back at the front of the castle.[A][Clear]
And Lord Hector was there waiting
for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I worked for him ever
since, milady.[A]
He changed my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So that's what happened...[A]

I'm looking into it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once you think about who might
be a traitor...[A]
any number of soldiers could betray
us for any number of reasons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.[A]
I'll have to go through them
individually, one by one...[A]
It won't be easy, I can tell
you that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most obvious suspect
would be that princess...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Guinivere, princess of Bern. There is
something suspicious about her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy trusts her.
I don't want to think that she...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our comrades would lose all trust in us if they
found out we suspect them of betrayal...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]It's rough, isn't it?
But someone's got to do it.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Yeah, about that.[A]
It took a while, but I feel confident
that there are no traitors.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere genuinely trusts
Lord Roy. And so does everyone else.[A]
This ragtag group has a stronger
bond than you might think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good...
That's a relief.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh. So that's taken

[OpenMidLeft]Hey, whoa,

[OpenMidRight]I first found him
collapsed in the desert.[A]
The heat had gotten to him, and
he'd lost his memory.[A]
He had blade wounds all over

It never fully healed, and it
left a scar.[A]

[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Please, let me tell

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.
I can do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]His name was Gorlois.[A]
We started to live together as
I nursed him back to health.[A]
We lived happily for
several years.[A]
Slowly, his memory started
returning.[A]
I was happy, but also...scared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.[A]
Gorlois left to fight them off
but he never came back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.[A]
I couldn't find Gorlois, so I
assumed the same happened to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, there you go.
There's your story.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't help but think in the bottom
of my heart that he might yet live.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah. Wishful thinking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...if he were alive, he wouldn't
have disappeared without a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He's probably living a pretty
miserable life now anyway.[A]

My husband had it when
I first met him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is this doodle?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's not a doodle.[A]
It's a seal given to
Lycian spies.[A]
I also did some research on
what kind of work they do...[A]
And...now I understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information
dangerous to their enemies.[A]
If a spy is caught, the enemy
will exploit any weakness.[A]
Family and loved ones are
often taken hostage...[A]
And the spy is tortured until he
spills every bit of information.[A]
That's why a spy must be alone...[A]
He must have no family, friends,
or loved ones...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry, but...
that guy is dead.[A]
He was devoured by the
quicksands of Nabata.[A]
All this stuff about spies...

you see things.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that sounds like him.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.[A]
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through practice.[A]
With another person of such talent
so close to him, what would he think?[A]
He'd work as hard--maybe even harder
than her,[A]
but he would still lag far behind.[A]
What would that do to his confidence?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That person of talent...
Do you mean me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Everyone has things they excel
at naturally.[A]
It was clear that Roy wouldn't
excel at magic,[A]
so I decided he would be better
off learning the sword instead.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Lilina, you will lead Ostia someday.
You should remember this...[A]
Assigning someone a task they do
not excel at is a waste of ability.[A]
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, don't you think
Roy has changed recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In what way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He's gotten cool-headed...[A]
Or rather, he's more confident when
he gives commands to the army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyone in charge of an army
gains traits like that.[A]
If Roy didn't grow, the army
would be doomed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, you said before
that I would lead Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are Lord Hector's
only heir after all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think I could be
like Roy? I mean...[A]
I couldn't even recognize
traitors in my own castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People grow according to their
potential.[A]
Even I didn't know what to do at
first when I was made Mage General.[A]
I was taken from Ostia and brought
to Aquileia. It was overwhelming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you succeeded
because of your talent...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not what I'm getting at.[A]
I've only made it so far thanks
to Perceval and General Douglas.[A]
Don't think that you'll have to
do everything on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even Roy isn't fighting alone.[A]
He puts his faith in everyone
around him.[A]
That is another important
attribute for someone in power.[A]
The ability to depend on others
when you need them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Can I depend on you, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I'll be glad to offer you
any help when you need it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you hafta when
you're a raider like me.[A]
Didja take it off or
somethin'?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I gave it away.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
You gave it away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I met an old blind man on the
way here.[A]
He said that he was starving,
so I gave it to him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, brother! You nobles
are so gullible![A]
He obviously tricked you.[A]
He made you pity him so
you'd give him money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...what if he was
telling the truth...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Listen kid, there's no way
he was tellin' the truth.[A]

If I don't get paid, I'll just
go back to bein' a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why don't you just
rob me right now, then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have magic tomes, jewelry...
A lot of expensive items.[A]
You can sell it for money.
Nobody would see you...[A]
Why don't you just take all
my belongings and run off?[A]

if you know I can do that?[A]
What if I really did it?[A]

[OpenMidRight]You said you gave your bracelet

[ToggleSmile]What would you do if you met
him again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's the point in even askin'?
I already know what'd happen.[A]
You'd get tricked just like before.
You'd give him anything he wanted.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Why do you care so much
for total strangers?[A]
What do you get from
helpin' 'em?[A]
Just ignore 'em.
Who cares?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...When I see people in need,
I feel I need to help them.[A]
If I met that blind man again,[A]
I'd probably give him something...
just like before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Oh well. I guess some
people are just born stupid.[A][Clear]
Oh yeah... Take this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is this for?[A]
Such a beautiful
bracelet...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dunno.[A]
Some old guy came up to me the other
day and said he'd met you.[A]
He asked me to give it to you.[A]
He said that he was really
grateful for everything.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Have you been keeping
up with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I've been wanting
to ask you.[A]
Why did you not
become a knight?[A]
Why did you become
a mercenary?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heavy armor doesn't
really suit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is simply because you don't
train yourself hard enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But, I mean,
I wasn't born with--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is a perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day.[A]
I will make a knight of you yet.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't have the
build that you do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Was that a complaint
I heard just now?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are doing well.
Excellent.[A]
Your body has gotten
used to the training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel uncomfortable if
I'm not working my body.[A]
I'd hate to fail for lack
of training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[A]
If you train yourself constantly,
you will never tire in battle.[A]
That holds true both for knights
like me and mercenaries like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Mercenaries like me?[A]
But I thought you wanted
to make me a knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I only said that to make you
train harder.[A]
I know your build can't
handle heavy armor.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It encouraged you,
didn't it?[A]

Why?[A]

A small band of entertainers stopped

Sacaen people worship the

It must have been a difficult journey.
Where did you go after you left us?[A]

After we lost the battle, I crossed

I rode through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.[A]
That is where I found her.[A]

There were soldiers clad in heavy armor

In the vast plains of Sacae, horses
are our livelihood.[A]
But in more populated areas,[A]
key points are defended by soldiers

It is not surprising that our

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yeah, I doubted myself a lot
after that.[A]
But we kept with it and decided to
go after a bigger ship next.[A]
We figured we could steal from the
rich and keep a clean conscience.[A]
Not long after that, we were lucky
and came across a large trading ship.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't have to hold back
this time.[A]
We charged the ship...[A]
But when we got close, ballistae and

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Well, I used to.
But now...not so much.[A]
I've had to stoop
to piracy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Never mind then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Did you
want something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was hopin' you might hire
me to work on your ship,[A]
but what's the point of goin'
from a bandit to a pirate?[A]
I...don't wanna rob for a
livin' anymore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.[A]
It doesn't suit me anyway.[A]
I'm going back to being a
trader after the war ends.[A]
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're gonna get
seasick.[A]
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a sailor.[A]
[OpenRight]What? A grown man, seasick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Age doesn't make any difference.[A]
I've seen plenty of grown men
puke their guts out.[A]
The outer seas can be
especially nasty.[A]
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip a ship over.[A]
Well, everyone gets used to it
after a month or so.[A]
[OpenRight]A month?[A]
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?[A]
But it's not like we'll be at
sea the whole time, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course we will.
The ocean's huge.[A]

personally, though.[A]

Geese, I must apologize.[A]
I misjudged you.[A]

He would have been found immediately.[A]
You were my only option.[A]
But being a pirate, I didn't
trust you completely.[A]
Even so, you kept your word.
For that, I thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure...
No problem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have turned him over to the

I hear that you helped the people

You did our nation a

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Etruria has changed much in the year
of your absence, Your Highness.[A]

Lord Elffin,[A]
you wished to speak with me?[A]
Is it about Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. It is about
what I said before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
When you said "Lord"?
I still don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you think it strange for an Etrurian
noble to call a simple bard "Lord"?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...!
Yes, you're right![A]
Forgive me.[A]
I shall call you Sir
Elffin instead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just Elffin will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, that will not do![A]
Even if you are in disguise, I cannot
address my prince simply by name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you remember how you used to come
to the palace with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
I spent much time there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I had no siblings, so I found you
so precious as a toddler.[A]
I was still young and foolish,
so I told your father,[A]
"Your son shall be my brother.
He is to live in the palace."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, the prince,
said that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know now that it
was ridiculous.[A]
Naturally, your father
struggled to respond.[A]
And then you spoke up.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. You said those same words.
"No, that will not do."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]"I will be your knight, so
that will not do."[A]
Those were your exact words.[A]
You also told me to find
someone else to be my brother.[A]

Forgive me, Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be absurd. I'm glad

I am glad to see you well.[A]
It appears you've adjusted well
to the position of commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I think I have.[A]
Though I am one of the least

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think
about this army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Frankly, I feel more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.[A]
Perhaps it is because of
General Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you feel,
General Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't feel completely
comfortable here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think what I seek from
an army doesn't exist here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying you can't get
used to this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, not quite.[A]
It is simply that I am, and will
always be, a knight of Etruria.[A]
It is difficult for me to serve

revolution in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I understand Bern was pulling strings
behind the scenes, but still...[A]
I never could have imagined the court
would divide so violently.[A]
To tell the truth, it's still
difficult for me to accept.[A]
I...I never thought that greed ruled
the minds of so many people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.[A]
Thus, blinded by peace, we paid no
heed to the scheming traitors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once this war is over, I will
devote my life to rebuilding Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, General Perceval.[A]
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein, I want you to
seek a different path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once I return to Etruria, I plan to
dismiss all but a few.[A]
The few I have absolute trust in
to stay loyal to the king and country.[A]
It is what must be done to maintain trust
among the king's vassals.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Perceval...
Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Klein...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please, think on it a
little more.[A][ToggleSmile]
With your ability, you won't have
to go to such extreme measures.[A]
I've been holding this in because
we are at war, but I will no longer.[A]
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, hello to you, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you know, I've been thinking...[A]
Before the revolution, we never
worked together like this.[A]

We fight together, not under the
Etrurian banner, but General Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm. Yes...

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed.[A]
Oh, to change the subject...[A]
Do you still like the same
foods as before?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? ...Yes, I think so.
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's just that the cook is a
little worried.[A]
He says that you are expressionless
no matter what you eat.[A]
He never knows what to give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressionless?
...Do you agree with him?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, very much so,
General Perceval.[A]
Even when you drink wine,
your expression stays the same.[A]
If you stop expressing emotion,
you'll forget how to.[A]

Her sword...
I couldn't even see it.[A]
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...In our family, the sword was
everything.[A]
We were raised by the sword,
and it was all we knew.[A]
The sword was so central to our lives...
that it blinded us to our own humanity.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Each time I lost, I challenged
her to a rematch.[A]
And then, the third time we fought,
I somehow evaded her first strike.[A]
I was knocked unconscious by her
second strike, though...[A]
But when I woke up...
there she was.[A]
It was the first time I'd seen
her smile.[A]
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves to be ever stronger.[A][Clear]
I was never able to defeat her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't see my sister
smile very often...[A]
She must have been
very fond of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...After she fell sick, Karla told me
about her family for the first time.[A]
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you in her time in this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That was around the time that
I first met you as well...[A]
You resembled Karla when I
first met her.[A]
You were inhumanly strong...
Dangerous and quiet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...That sounds like me.[A]
I remember leaving the two
of you without a word.[A][ToggleSmile]
You must have thought me a
terrible brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
As she lay dying, Karla told me
about her childhood with you...[A]
She would tell me so many stories,
all with a smile on her face.[A]

I was just borrowing it.[A]
I was planning to give

I lent it to you because you

I didn't expect you to run

[OpenMidLeft]Look, like I said, I'm

[OpenMidRight]Then when are you

Forgive me. I have

for helping me.[A]
I no longer feel alienated in
this army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
It is my pleasure.[A]
Tryffin, your master is
a very kind-hearted person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a
lot of difficulty.[A]
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...[A]
I dragged her along with me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I hear that Bern's training instills
absolute loyalty in its troops.[A]
Both in the knights, and in
the mounts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, definitely.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is so, why do you think
Tryffin follows you against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There are other wyvern riders of
Bern in the enemy ranks we fight.[A]
There are even high-ranking
commanders and generals.[A]
If this wyvern only followed the army's
commands, she would not have stayed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand
what that means?[A]
This wyvern has a will of
her own.[A]
She chose to be with you.[A]
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinivere.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]That is very much like you.

[OpenMidRight]And what's that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria will regain its
former glory.[A]
It will become more prosperous
than ever before.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
We will make it happen
with our own hands.[A]

[OpenMidRight]I am considering stepping down as

That would leave the highest position

I want you to take my place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am still so young, General Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think yourself young?
What of our commander, Roy?[A]
He is much younger than you,
yet he leads all of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The youth will have no room to grow
if the old hang onto their positions.[A]
Perceval, you are brilliant, strong
and a natural leader.[A]
Once the prince returns, the king
will abdicate the throne anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Douglas![A]
Those in service are forbidden to speak
of the inheritance of the throne...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is no matter.[A]
I have served the king for decades.
I know him better than any.[A]
Once he learns of the prince's survival,
I am certain he will give him the throne.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We must rebuild Etruria

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas,
about our conversation before...[A]
Can you at least assure me that your
nation has no reason to attack Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You already have so much wealth...
Why is that so unreasonable?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Attacks can be ordered
even without the king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria is a large nation governed by
various families of nobility.[A]
Not all nobles are kind at heart.[A]
If such nobles took over the court,
there is nothing the king or I could do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what is there to gain
from a desert like Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not about gold for such people...
They simply enjoy showing their power.[A]
They feel no worth unless they are
stepping upon another.[A]
I understand that the people in the
Western Isles suffered such abuse.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I have already said this, but in my
position, I cannot promise what you ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, I will do my utmost to ensure
the likelihood of an attack is minimized.[A]
I shall spread word that a warrior of Nabata
was among the heroes who rescued the king.[A]
I will do all I can to persuade the nobles
never to disturb your peace in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I shall remember
those words.[A]
I suppose I can ask
no more of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[A]

Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived in this land.[A]
The demons used their immense

The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...[A]
And then one day...
eight bright rays of light came.[A]
They could be used to defeat
the demons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were they pretty lights?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh my, yes.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, most unfortunate, that.[A]
But there's nothing to be done

Anyway, I need something from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Give me back that Nosferatu tome I
lent you when I sent you out.[A]
You have no use for it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gulp...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...do have it, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hugh, those tomes are hard

I sincerely hope you didn't
pawn it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait!
No, no, no![A]
I didn't sell it!
I gave it away![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
And that's any better?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, but listen![A]
I met this kid who was studying dark magic,
and I traveled with him for a while.[A]
The kid was an orphan, so I felt kinda
bad for him, I guess.[A]
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the tome![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you didn't give it away.
A child stole it from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose that's one
way of putting it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the only way

I don't really remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I really did try to study dark magic,
but I couldn't seem to pick it up at all.[A]
That kid I told you about was
doing great, though.[A]
I thought that maybe I don't have the
talent, so I switched to anima magic.[A]
But the thing is, how can I not have the
talent for it when I have your blood?[A]
That's why I wanna know if my old man
had the talent or not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your father had more talent for dark
magic than you could ever hope for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
That makes no sense.[A]

Of course![A]
[OpenMidLeft]An epiphany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes! You're not really my

O-ow! What did you do
that for?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your stupidity. I'm your
grandmother, like it or not.[A]
You would never have been born
were it not for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's impossible![A]
This handsome face couldn't have
come from those hideous wrinkles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was a stunning beauty when I was

I would court men like you and drop them
once I'd milked all the money out of them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ouch...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your kindness comes from your father,[A]
and your talent for anima magic
comes from your mother.[A]
Your stupidity... That's probably
from your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
My mom wasn't a shaman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was determined at first to make my son's
wife a shaman.[A]
But your mother was a fine young lady with a
distinct talent for anima magic, so I caved...[A]

And yet they died so young...[A]

a pathetic failure of a grandson.[A]
