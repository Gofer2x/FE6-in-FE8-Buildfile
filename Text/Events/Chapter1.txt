[OpenMidRight][LoadBanditKid]
Boss![AN]
They've all hidden themselves[N]
inside the castle![AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDamas]
Heh. Even Eliwood, the greatest knight in[N]
Lycia, is no match for an illness, it seems.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Hee hee hee...[AN]
You were right when you said[N]
there wouldn't be many soldiers.[AN]
They're all getting ready[N]
to defend against Bern![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Of course I was right.[N]
I'm always right, you fool.[AN]
But reinforcements could be[N]
here any minute.[AN][2NL]
All right, you curs, listen up![AN]
Kill everyone in the castle[N]
while we still got time![AN]
Then we can waltz outta[N]
here with all the loot![AN][X]





## Ch1_StartBrigandVillage

[OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan]
Heh heh, castles ain't the only[N]
places with loot.[AN]
Let's go ransack the villages[N]
and take everything they got![AN][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadEliwood]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Eliwood![AN]
We're under attack by[N]
bandits from Mount Bolm![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I understand. Thank you, Merlinus...[AN]
Blast it! Were I not in this pitiful state,[N]
I would take care of them all myself...![AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina]
Lord Eliwood...?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Lilina, you must hide yourself.[AN]
This castle is going to[N]
become a war zone.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
No, my lord.[N]
I can fight, too![AN]

[OpenMidRight]Don't be absurd.[AN]
I couldn't face Hector if something[N]
happened to you in my own castle.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
My father?[N]
But...[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's going to be all right.[AN]
Roy should be here any moment, so we[N]
just need to hold our own until then.[AN]
He'll drive off these dastards.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Merlinus![AN]
Send a messenger to Roy to let[N]
him know the current situation![AN]
We need his help![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, milord![AN][ClearFace][X]






## Ch1_Start3

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance]

[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
Oh, it's Lance![N]
What's the matter?[AN]
Why are you in such a hurry?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Roy![AN]
Bandits have appeared and are attacking[N]
the castle as we speak![AN]

[OpenFarRight][LoadAlen]
No![N]
Is the marquess unharmed?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
He's inside, defending against[N]
the bandits' attack.[AN]
But I don't know how long he can[N]
last with his illness...![AN]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][LoadBors]
Excuse me. Lance, is it?[N]
Is Lady Lilina safe?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You must be a knight of Ostia.[N]
Lady Lilina is in the castle.[AN]
She should be all right.[AN]
She's with Lord Eliwood after all,[N]
but he can't last forever.[AN]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

[OpenRight]
No...[AN]
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to[N]
the castle before me.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadWolt]
Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything![N]
We must retake the castle![AN]

[OpenLeft][LoadMarcus]
Wolt is right.[N]
We must make haste![AN]

[OpenRight]
Yes, you're right.[N]
This is no time to despair.[AN][Clear]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenRight]
Very well. To arms then![AN]
Our target is the castle![N]
We must rescue everyone![AN][X]





## Ch1_Start4
[OpenMidRight][LoadDamas][ToggleSmile]
Curses![N]
Reinforcements already![AN]
But they'll have to go through[N]
me to get into the castle![AN][X]




## Ch1_SouthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1][ToggleSmile]
Are you knights going[N]
to the castle?[AN]
I know this isn't much...[AN]
But please accept this money[N]
on behalf of all of us.[AN]
Use it well![AN][X]



## Ch1_DoomHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
We're all doomed...[AN]
Soldiers from Bern have[N]
crossed the border...[AN]
They laid an awful attack.[AN]
And even if the allied lords[N]
strike back, Lord Eliwood...[AN]
He can't even stand anymore...[AN][X]



## Ch1_TerrainHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]
Listen![AN]
If you wanna do well in battle[N]
you'd better use terrain wisely.[AN]
For example, if you're in a forest[N]
the trees will cover you.[AN]
That'll teach your enemies who[N]
they're dealing with.[AN][X]



## Ch1_MoneyHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager2][ToggleSmile]
Money is vital for any army.[AN]
If you don't have any, you won't be[N]
able to replace your broken weapons.[AN]
And you can't fight[N]
without weapons![AN][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadEliwood][ToggleSmile]
Roy, is that you?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina]
Roy![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm so glad to see you both![N]
Thank goodness you're unharmed.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft]
Thanks for the rescue, Roy.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course, Father.[N]
How is your health?[AN]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Well enough.[N]
I've some life in me yet.[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]But Roy, do you know why[N]
I called you back here?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm to take over your role by[N]
leading the soldiers of Pherae.[AN]
We must join the rest of the Lycian[N]
Army to defend our people.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Exactly.[AN]
As you know, Bern has[N]
commenced an invasion of Lycia.[AN]
We are honorbound to follow[N]
the vows of our allegiance.[AN]
Lycia needs every lord's army,[N]
and we must oblige.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Of course.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
I'm truly sorry to interrupt your[N]
studies and force you into this war,[AN]
but I'm not well... I'm in no[N]
condition to lead an army.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Father...[AN][SendToBack]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina][ToggleSmile]
Lord Eliwood![N]
I'll go with Roy![AN]
My father leads[N]
Lycia's largest army.[AN]
And I'm certain my magic will[N]
be of help to Roy...[AN][SendToBack]

[OpenLeft]
No, Lilina.[N]
You must return to Ostia.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenRight][LoadLilina][ToggleSmile]
...Why?[AN][.....]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
With Hector preparing for battle, there is[N]
no one sitting on the throne of Ostia.[AN]
It must be an uneasy feeling for the[N]
people not to have a sitting lord.[AN]
As the daughter of the marquess, you must[N]
take the throne until Hector returns.[AN]
That will put the people at ease.[AN]
Do you have any objections?[AN]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
...No, my lord.[AN]

[OpenRight][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]

Roy, I have arranged a contract with[N]
a group of mercenaries.[AN]
You are to meet them at the border to[N]
Bern. Merlinus will accompany you.[AN]
He is knowledgable and experienced and[N]
should be of great help.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for everything,[N]
Father.[AN]

[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, my son.[N]
I have absolute faith in you![AN]
Fight bravely, and show everyone who[N]
the next marquess of Pherae is![AN]
