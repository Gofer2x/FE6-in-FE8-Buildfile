## Ch10A_Start1
[OpenMidRight][LoadNord][ToggleSmile]What can you tell me about[N]
that spy from the resistance?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2]You mean the dancer[N]
called Larum?[AN]
We threw her in the[N]
dungeon, milord.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Has she told[N]
you anything?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No. She keeps insisting that she's[N]
not affiliated with the resistance.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A liar, is she?[AN]
Perhaps I should[N]
interrogate her myself...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sir Nord![AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is a messenger here[N]
from the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Ah, the army that was sent to[N]
clean up the bandits on the Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It seems that they want permission[N]
to pass through to Eburacum.[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]...Lord Arcardo told us to get rid of[N]
the Lycian Army in their time here.[AN]
Heh heh heh... If we impress Lord Arcardo[N]
he may see fit to reward us.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Deploy the troops and[N]
finish them here![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord...[AN][Clear]
And the messenger?[AN]
[OpenRight]Kill him.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understood, milord.[AN]
[OpenRight]Be sure to deploy[N]
the ballista.[AN]
Use it to defeat the Lycian Army[N]
before they even reach you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, milord.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just make sure the enemy[N]
doesn't get hold of it![AN][X]

## Ch10A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, soldiers are[N]
flowing out from the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Are there bandits[N]
around here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, they seem to be[N]
heading toward us, actually.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...What about the messenger?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]He hasn't returned...[N]
Which may mean the worst...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]He hasn't returned?[AN]
Why is Sir Nord attacking us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The enemy draws near...[N]
Lord Roy, what are your orders?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...I guess we have no[N]
choice but to fight.[AN]
We might learn something if[N]
we can reach the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[N]
You're right.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]All right, storm the castle![AN]
But have mercy! Some of their soldiers[N]
may be willing to listen![AN][X]

## Ch10A_GonzalezAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadNord][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez![N]
Gonzalez, where are you?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][FastPrint]Here... I here...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]There's a village to the north,[N]
right along the mountain.[AN]
Do you understand?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understand.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]It may be a resistance base.[AN]
I want you to go and burn it to[N]
the ground, village and all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good. You understand.[AN]
This is the only use I have[N]
for a lump such as you.[AN]
Now get going, you halfwit,[N]
before you forget your orders.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I...I...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Forget how to speak?[N]
Are you trying to say something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]N-no...[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Such a monstrous face, and yet such[N]
a needlessly compassionate heart.[AN]
He will learn the value of[N]
destroying a village firsthand![AN][X]

## Ch10A_SwordreaverVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager40]
[ToggleSmile]I'm worried about Larum.[N]
I hope she's all right.[AN]
She smuggled us weapons[N]
so we could defend ourselves.[AN]
Even when we begged her to hide,[N]
she refused and kept helping us.[AN][Clear]
Here's an axe that she brought us.[N]
It's a strange one...[AN]
It's strong against swords,[N]
but weak against lances![AN]
I'd gladly trade it for her safety,[N]
though, so please, take it...[AN][X]

## Ch10A_RecruitBaddiesHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager44]
[ToggleSmile]Brigands and pirates... They were all just as[N]
innocent as anyone when they were young.[AN]
Maybe if you spoke to some of them,[N]
you could make them understand.[AN][X]

## Ch10A_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...[AN]
We couldn't find any evidence[N]
explaining Sir Nord's aggression.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But now we know for certain[N]
that somebody wants our heads.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I think we should send word to[N]
the mainland about this.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'll send a message[N]
to General Cecilia.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]Excuse me, Lord Roy.[AN]
We found a girl imprisoned[N]
in the dungeon.[AN]
She wishes to speak with you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]To me?[N]
Let her pass.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]You're Roy?[AN]
The one who's here to clear[N]
out the bandits?[SendToBack][AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, that's me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][SendToBack][CloseSpeechFast]I beg you, Roy![N]
Please rescue my friends![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Whoa, easy there![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][MoveLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hey![N]
Get off of him![AN]
[OpenFarRight]C-calm down and[N]
tell me everything.[AN]
You say your friends[N]
are in danger?[AN][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]My name is Larum.[AN]
I'm part of the resistance[N]
force on the Isles.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]The force that's fighting[N]
against the bandits?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[AN]
...Actually, no![AN]
[OpenFarRight]No?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's part of it,[N]
but the real enemy is Etruria![AN]
They work with the bandits to squeeze every[N]
bit they can out of the people here![AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?![N]
Is that true?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The lords living here take people into[N]
the mines and work them to death!![AN]
They're allowed no rest, even[N]
if they're sick or injured.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...That's terrible...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We're fighting Etruria[N]
to stop this abuse![AN]
Our next plan was to attack the mine at[N]
Eburacum and rescue the people there![AN]
But...but...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Calm down![N]
You can tell me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]A villager here leaked the[N]
details of the plan![AN]
He was probably tortured...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]I have to go to the mines before[N]
the resistance is ambushed![SendToBack][AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then there's no time to spare![AN]
We'll help the resistance force and rescue[N]
the people being forced into labor![AN]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Truly, you will?![N]
Thank you, Roy![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Whoa![N]
L-Larum![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][MoveLeft]Hey![N]
I said get off of him![AN][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here, Roy.[N]
Use this sword.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's called a wyrmslayer.[AN]
It's effective against wyvern riders, and[N]
it's said it was used against dragons, too.[AN]
Who can say, though?[N]
It might come in handy.[AN]
It belongs to Echidna, the leader[N]
of the resistance.[AN]
You're helping us though, so you[N]
can have it for now.[AN][X]
