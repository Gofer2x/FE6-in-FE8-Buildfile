[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechFast]So Princess Guinivere isn't[N]
in the Western Isles?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We searched every inch of the Isles,[AN]
and our intelligence has learned[N]
nothing from the Lycian Army.[AN]
The princess is nowhere to be found.[N]
I apologize.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[N]
I will continue my search elsewhere.[AN]
Bern thanks you for your[N]
cooperation, Father Orlo.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I pray that you find[N]
Princess Guinivere soon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[AN][ClearFace][X]

## Ch11A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadOrlo]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Who was that,[N]
Father Orlo?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Captain Melady. A wyvern rider from Bern[N]
who serves Princess Guinivere.[AN]
She's searching for the princess.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you tell her where[N]
the princess is?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.[N]
Princess Guinivere is far too valuable.[AN]
High Chancellor Roartz was ecstatic when[N]
he learned the princess was in Aquileia.[AN]
He had the same evil glint in his eye[N]
when Prince Myrddin was assassinated.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Father Orlo![AN]
You must never speak of[N]
the assassination...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes, I must watch my tongue.[AN]
Regardless, the princess is secure.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's reassuring...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So, why have you[N]
come before me?[AN]
Surely not just for[N]
court gossip?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, milord.[AN]
It's regarding the village where the[N]
leader of the resistance hides.[AN]
We are prepared to attack,[N]
so I am here for instructions.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Well done.[AN]
Commence the attack immediately, before[N]
any unpleasant interruptions arrive...[AN][X]

## Ch11A_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The resistance hideout[N]
is in this village?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but the castle's troops[N]
may have attacked already.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]I must say, that Orlo sounds like a[N]
despicable wretch of a man.[AN]
A bishop should preach the words[N]
of the gods to help the people.[AN]
But what he's doing is nothing[N]
more than torture![AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]It would be best to wait for[N]
General Cecilia's reply, but...[AN][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy![AN]
The castle troops are[N]
attacking the village![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]Oh dear, no![N]
Lord Roy, should we attack?[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]I suppose there's no time[N]
to await the reply...[AN]
The people here need our help,[AN]
even if doing so means souring[N]
our relationship with Etruria...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum]Roy...[AN]
[OpenRight]We fight!![AN]
Make Lycia proud of our[N]
actions here today![AN][X]

## Ch11A_MeladyGalleLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadGalle]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Melady, have you discovered[N]
where Princess Guinivere is?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
It appears she has left[N]
the Lycian Army.[AN]
I thought we were[N]
so close...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It was a[N]
dead end then.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Galle...[N]
I'm sorry.[AN]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter[N]
of Princess Guinivere a secret,[AN]
so only I was assigned to search[N]
for her.[AN]
I'm sorry to get you mixed[N]
up in this...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry yourself.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But you work directly under General[N]
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]General Murdock agreed to allow[N]
me to assist you.[AN]
If she isn't here, then Princess[N]
Guinivere must be on the mainland.[AN]
I'll ask General Narcian for some[N]
additional assistance.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You're going to[N]
bow to Narcian?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Hm?[N]
Of course.[AN]
He's one of the three[N]
Wyvern Generals.[AN]
He leads the offense on[N]
Lycia and Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Galle, doesn't that...[N]
frustrate you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Why should it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You were to be a Wyvern General.[AN]
But Narcian put forth that you're not a Bern[N]
native and took the title for himself.[AN]
And you're going to bow down to him[N]
and request his help?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What he said is only the truth...[N]
I wasn't born in Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Still...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm pleased with the position[N]
I have now.[AN]
The king and General Murdock trust me,[N]
even though I'm not of Bern by birth.[AN]
To ask any more would be nothing[N]
but greed.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Galle...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadVillager45][CloseSpeechFast]Echidna, I'm so sorry! They[N]
threatened the lives of my family...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't blame you.[N]
I'll handle this.[AN]
Hurry home to your family now.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]I'm sorry...[N]
Truly.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]Surrender peacefully and Father Orlo[N]
may have mercy on you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I've always been a stubborn wench.[N]
I have no intention of going quietly.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You resist?[N]
Then you leave us no choice![AN][Clear]
Take her head![AN][X]

## Ch11A_OrloLaughsAndSendsBandits
[OpenMidRight][LoadOrlo]Ha ha ha... I've a[N]
delicious idea... You there![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, milord?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell the brigands the[N]
village is in disarray.[AN]
Have them collect all the[N]
money and valuables.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, milord.[N]
But...are you certain of this?[AN]
If this becomes public--[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You forget that I[N]
speak for the gods.[AN]
To accuse me is to oppose[N]
Saint Elimine![AN]
I am immune to persecution![AN]
Hurry. Before the villagers[N]
realize what's happening.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[AN][X]

## Ch11A_BanditsAppear
[OpenMidRight][LoadScollan]We can ransack[N]

But in return...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, yeah. Take half the[N]
loot to the castle, right?[AN]
That bishop in charge of you guys is[N]
a real piece of work, y'know that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Don't disappoint him.[AN][ClearFace]

from the mountains in the east.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They aim to attack the[N]
village in the chaos...[AN]
We must stop them and help[N]
the villagers![AN][X]

## Ch11A_OrloComplainsAndTalksAboutReinforcements
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is taking so long?![AN]
Is the resistance force[N]
so powerful?![AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's the Lycian Army![AN]
They are supporting the[N]
resistance...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![AN]
The Lycian League would[N]
turn against Etruria?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Actually, yes. We've just received[N]
a missive from Juteaux![AN]
The Lycian Army is responsible[N]
for the death of Sir Nord.[AN]
They are suspected of betraying[N]
Etruria's interests.[AN]
They may also have ties with[N]
the bandits.[AN]
Lord Arcardo now wants them[N]
dead or alive.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They killed Sir Nord,[N]
you say...?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]It seems they finally have just cause[N]
to get rid of the Lycian Army.[AN]
Ties with bandits? The Lycian Army?[N]
Oh, the irony...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo has sent reinforcements[N]
to help capture the Lycian Army.[AN]
They should arrive shortly.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He says "capture", but I'm sure he[N]
he intends to kill them.[AN]
Let us do the job for him.[N]
Eradicate them![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, milord![AN][X]

## Ch11A_MoreReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight]Father Orlo, the reinforcements[N]

That puts my mind at ease...[AN]
I don't know what I'd say to Elffin[N]
if something happened to you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry... If I hadn't been caught[N]
I could have warned you...[AN]

They've come a long[N]
way to get here...[AN]
Does it look like they'll[N]

Anyway, how many staves[N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I am pleased to meet you.[N]
My name is Elffin.[AN]
I am a member of the[N]

[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the[N]
Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You have my thanks for[N]
saving our village here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We simply did what[N]
we believe is right.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you stand[N]
against Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Even so, I have[N]
no regrets.[AN]
We may have opposed Etruria's[N]
immediate interests,[AN]
but once the truth about the Isles is[N]
out, I'm certain they will understand.[AN]
I sent a letter to a trustworthy[N]
Etrurian noble.[AN]
If she takes appropriate measures,[N]
they will send us aid.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not[N]
be so sure...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why is that?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't you find it odd that Etruria[N]
requested your help here at all?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...yes, I do.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]If I may be so bold as to guess...[AN]
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and[N]
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...It was.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]There may have been ulterior motives for[N]
sending your army away.[AN]
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was[N]
undesirable to them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I never even[N]
considered that...[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]There are rumors...that Roartz and[N]
Arcardo are working with Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?![N]
Then Lycia is in danger![AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]L-Lord Roy![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Your country may be in peril.[AN]
Are you free to waste your time[N]
on the Isles as you are?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]He's right![AN]
Bern wanted us out of Lycia so[N]
they could launch an invasion![AN]
We must head back at once![AN]
[OpenRight]...We stay here.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?![N]
Why?![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]It's difficult to judge what may[N]
be hearsay and what may be truth.[AN]
We can't simply jump on this[N]
rumor and run back to Lycia.[AN]
I am certainly concerned, but my father[N]
and General Cecilia are there.[AN]
The people on the Isles have only[N]
us to rely on.[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That may be, but...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]If we leave without finishing our mission,[N]
then all we've done here was for naught.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]...Your army is blessed with[N]
a levelheaded leader.[AN]
[OpenRight]What?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Lord Roy, I am sorry for[N]
testing you so.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Testing us?[N]
So that was a lie?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]It was the truth.[AN]
However, I presented the rumor in a[N]
way that you might take rash action.[AN]
Your leader is a prudent individual.[N]
I would join you if you allow it.[AN]
[OpenRight]...I don't like that[N]
you tested us.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]But if you can help,[N]
I welcome you.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Now, back to the concern we face here.[AN]
What can we do to help the[N]
people of the Isles?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]We must go to the[N]
capital. To Juteaux.[AN]
The people will only be liberated[N]
if the corruption is overthrown.[AN]
[OpenRight]Then it's settled![N]
We head for Juteaux![AN]
We fight for the people![N]
We will defeat the true enemy![AN][X]
