## Ch11B_Start1
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager43][ToggleSmile]Hurry![N]
This way![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager45]A-are you sure about this?[N]
If we get caught we're--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be stupid![AN]
If we stay, we'll be[N]
worked to death![AN]
You're just going to lie[N]
down and take that?[AN]
Don't you have a family[N]
or something back home?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]There are people coming to[N]
help us from the northeast.[AN]
We just have to make it[N]
there in one piece![AN][X]

## Ch11B_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]More people escaped?![AN]
[MoveMidRight]Where were the guards?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRoberts]They were unconscious.[N]
Someone drugged their food...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Then there must be a[N]
traitor among us.[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Morgan![OpenLeft][LoadMorgan][AN]
[OpenMidRight]Pursue and eliminate[N]
the escaped workers.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes, Lord Arcardo.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I will return to Juteaux.[N]
Don't let them escape.[AN]
Send more hands to the mines as well.[N]
I can't afford to lose more workers![AN][X]

## Ch11B_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin, is that castle to[N]
the southwest our target?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is Castle Eidyna.[AN]
The people kidnapped on the Isles[N]
are first sent there.[AN]
They are then taken to Eburacum[N]
and forced to work in the mines.[AN]
As it happens, today is the weekly[N]
shipment of captives to the mines.[AN]
It will be difficult to rescue[N]
them once they've been sent off.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then you're saying we have[N]
to rescue them now![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[AN]
I already had some spies infiltrate the[N]
castle and help the people escape.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What will the captives[N]
do once they're out?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I told them to send the[N]
captives to the northeast.[AN]
In other words, our[N]
present location.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must rescue those people[N]
before sieging the castle.[AN][X]

## Ch11B_BartreAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager45][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're imprisoned in[N]
that castle, you say?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then we've no time to lose. Let's begin[N]
this daring prison break, shall we?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry to ask for[N]
your help like this.[AN]
I know you're looking[N]
for your daughter...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be absurd! Consider it[N]
payment for your hospitality.[AN]
I won't let some blood-sucking[N]
lord take advantage of his people![AN][Clear]
I'm Bartre the Brave, and I'll[N]
smash these puny insects![AN][X]

## Ch11B_RoyRecruitsBartre
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you with[N]
Etruria?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Y-yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We fight for the people[N]
suffering under your tyranny![AN]
En garde![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]W-wait![N]
We're on your side![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You aren't with[N]
the castle?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We're trying to capture[N]
it, actually.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh![N]
Sorry then.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy, leader of[N]
the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia?[N]
You've come a long way...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We were sent by Etruria to rid[N]
the Isles of the bandits.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What's that?![N]
So you are with Etruria![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Please calm yourself![N]
We share the same goal.[AN]
We want to bring peace[N]
to the Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...You may end up against[N]
Etrurian nobility.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Our mission is to find and[N]
eliminate wrongdoers on the Isles.[AN]
Social status matters not.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You, my friend, are[N]
a man of conviction![AN]
Very well! I think I'll[N]
join your little army![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You'll help us?[N]
Thank you![AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadFir]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Father?[N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Fir![N]
I've been looking for you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Father,[N]
I've already made up my mind.[AN]
I want to become a great master[N]
of the sword like Mother...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is good.[N]
I don't intend to drag you home.[AN]
In fact, I want to help you[N]
in your journey.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Help me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know well the hardships one faces[N]
in a journey of self-improvement.[AN]
I can help you out of a bind if[N]
things get rough.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you keep helping me,[N]
my training is meaningless.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]With your old man around, we can[N]
practice sparring any time![AN]
Do you refuse your[N]
father's love?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]No! It's nothing[N]
like that, but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's settled then.[AN]
But first we capture[N]
the castle.[AN]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]I guess I should tell Roy that[N]
we have another member...[AN][X]

## Ch11B_ReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMorgan][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Morgan,[N]
the reinforcements are ready![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[N]
Deploy them immediately.[AN]
Spread them around the castle[N]
to defend us on all sides.[AN][X]

## Ch11B_RedGemVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager47]
Are you the guys[N]
helping us out?[AN]
Then please, take this.[AN]
I grabbed it as I escaped[N]
from the castle.[AN]
I hope everyone else[N]
made it out...[AN][X]

## Ch11B_EndElffinDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin![N]
Are you all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This wound is great...[N]
But still, I must not...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You should stay off the battlefield.[N]
Leave the fighting to us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are right...[N]
Forgive my being a hindrance...[AN][X]

## Ch11B_End1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even though we've saved the[N]
people at Castle Eidyna,[AN]
there are others still[N]
suffering in the mines.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[AN]
To liberate the Western Isles,[N]
we must take the capital.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then our next destination[N]
is Juteaux.[AN]
...Elffin, may I ask[N]
you something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, Lord Roy.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Pardon me if I am[N]
mistaken,[AN]
but are you of high[N]
Etrurian nobility?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!![AN][Clear]
...What makes you think that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I can't quite explain[N]
it, but...[AN]
The way you talk sounds[N]
very educated.[AN]
In Ostia, I learned how to study[N]
others and size them up.[AN]
Am I right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What would you do[N]
if you are?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh. Nothing[N]
in particular.[AN]
I'm sure you have a good reason[N]
to hide your identity.[AN]
You can tell me when you[N]
feel the time is right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Let's head for Juteaux![AN]
To save the Isles and defeat[N]
the true enemy of the people![AN][X]

[OpenLeft]Hey, you with the mustache![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![N]
Who are you?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Here, give this[N]
to General Roy.[AN]
Thanks to him, we can see[N]
our families again.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]We of the Western Isles always[N]
pay our debts of gratitude![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]Tell him thanks.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]We're all grateful from the[N]
bottom of our hearts![AN][X]
