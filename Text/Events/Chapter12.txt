[OpenMidLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]S-S...[N]
Sir Flaer![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo.[N]
Why do you fret so?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's the Lycian Army![N]
They come for my blood![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yes, they have been a thorn[N]
in Bern's side for some time...[AN]
We knew it would be difficult if they[N]
became too close with Etruria.[AN]
That's why we had you send them here.[N]
Ending them should have been simple.[AN]
It seems, however, they fight[N]
even better than expected.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You don't understand the gravity[N]
of this situation![AN]
Do you realize how much I've[N]
lost thanks to their meddling?[AN]
All the riches I've reaped[N]
from these islands are gone![AN]
...And on top of that,[N]
now they want my life![AN]
Once they arrive, my legacy[N]
is finished![AN]
My hands are shaking.[N]
I don't know what to do...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My, how you worry.[AN]
I suggest you flee to the mainland.[N]
To Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You will allow it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Warfare is Bern's strong suit.[AN]
We also have our secret[N]
weapon ready to brandish.[AN]
With it we shall erase the[N]
Lycian Army once and for all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo.[AN]
Once Bern and Etruria join forces,[N]
we will have no reason to fear anyone.[AN]
Am I wrong?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]No... No![N]
You're right.[AN]
I leave them to you.[AN][ClearFace][X]

## Ch12_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer][ToggleSmile]Hmph, cowardly Etrurian nobles.[AN]
If we defeat the Lycian Army here,[N]
the Isles shall be ours...[AN][X]

## Ch12_Start3BartreRoute
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...[AN]
Once we take it,[N]
we can finally go home.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]Lord Roy,[AN]
I have heard some troubling rumors[N]
from the people living around here.[AN]
They say an "unhuman"[N]
resides in the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They say there is a man who[N]
changes form...into a dragon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]A man?[N]
Who turns into a dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I can say nothing more at this point,[N]
but we must proceed with caution.[AN][X]

## Ch12_Start3EchidnaRoute
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Once we take it,[N]
we can finally go home.[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadElffin][ToggleSmile]I have already sent someone[N]
in to unlock the gate...[AN][OpenFarLeft][LoadLarum]
[OpenFarRight]Oh, there she is.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The one over there[N]
dressed like a dancer?[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Yes, that's her.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Highness![N]
[MoveFarLeft]Over[MoveFarLeft] here![AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Your Highness?[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]...I know not of[N]
what she speaks.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Highness![N]
You're late.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Larum, why do you call[N]
me "Your Highness"?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]Huh? ...Oh![N]
Ah...er...[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you know, you look like[N]
royalty, so it's your nickname![AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
My apologies, Lord Roy.[AN]
This is Larum, a member[N]
of the resistance.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're Roy?[AN]
Everyone on the Isles[N]
has heard of you![AN]
They all call you the[N]
Savior from the East.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Nice to meet you![N]
I'm Larum.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa![N]
Please leave a little distance![AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, your face is all red.[N]
How cute!![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]...Larum...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Oh! R-right...[N]
There's something I should tell you.[AN]
I've been hearing strange rumors.[AN]
The people here say that an[N]
"unhuman" resides in this castle.[AN]
[OpenRight]An "unhuman"...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes.[AN]
They say he changes form into[N]
something that looks like a dragon![AN]
[OpenRight]A human?[N]
That can change into a dragon?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know...[N]
but that's what I hear.[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]We must proceed[N]
with caution.[AN][SendToBack][X]

## Ch12_EinAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEin][OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer]Ah, there[N]
you are, Ein.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You called...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will make a report about the[N]
Lycian Army to General Narcian.[AN]
I want you to defend the castle[N]
while I am away.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Hm?[N]
Who's there?![AN][Clear][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]Just the wind...?[AN][.....][Clear]
Ahem. I will take my leave now.[N]
I leave them to your discretion.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ha ha... The Lycian Army will hardly be[N]
able to stand against this dragon.[AN]
Normal weapons won't even scratch[N]
its skin.[AN]
These manaketes...[N]
They certainly are terrifying beasts.[AN][X]

## Ch12_RaighDragon
[OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh]...So that's what[N]
the "unhuman" is.[AN]
Bern really has brought[N]
dragons into this world.[AN]
...What to do now...?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I'll pose as a soldier[N]
and observe the dragon's power.[AN][X]

## Ch12_CathAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]La la la la la,[.....]
la la la la la...[AN]
All the way out here[N]
in the Isles West,[AN]
folks work to death for[N]
nobles in their nest![AN][Clear]
This castle's sure to be[N]
brimming with treasure![AN]
All this loot was stolen[N]
anyway.[AN]
Might as well take it off[N]
these nobles' hands.[AN][X]

## Ch12_ReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEin][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]The reinforcements from the[N]
south will arrive shortly![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Th-that's all, sir.[AN][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight]That guy gives[N]
me chills...[AN][X]

## Ch12_GaidenGone
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]Did you handle the cave on[N]
the outskirts of town?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier6]Yes, sir.[AN]
The bandits have blocked[N]
off all entrance to it.[AN]
No one will be able to get to[N]
the legendary weapon now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent![AN]
Now all we have to do is[N]
clean up the Lycian Army.[AN][X]

## Ch12_LughRecruitsRaigh
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Raigh? Raigh![N]
It's so good to see you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...![N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you're OK.[N]
We were all worried about you.[AN]
I know you wanted to train your magic[N]
skills, but you left so suddenly.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I couldn't have learned magic if[N]
I'd stayed in that orphanage.[AN]
It was a miracle I picked[N]
up as much as I did.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Raigh...[N]
The orphanage is gone.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What?[N]
What happened?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Bern came...and[N]
burned it down.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...What happened to everybody?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Poppa was killed[N]
trying to protect us...[AN]
The young children are under the[N]
care of the St. Elimine Church now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[N]
It's for the best...[AN]
They'll be happier at the church[N]
than at that dilapidated orphanage.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to be[N]
so callous about it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Raigh![N]
Come with us.[AN]
We'll defeat Bern, and then we[N]
can go back to the children![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry,[N]
not interested.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But--[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then again...the Lycian Army[N]
might be good company.[AN]
They're sure to come across[N]
more dragons at some point.[AN]
All right, you got me.[N]
I suppose I'll go with you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Raigh...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I just want you to[N]
know one thing.[AN]
I'm not joining to avenge[N]
Poppa or the orphanage![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know, Raigh.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then stop looking[N]
at me like that![AN][X]

## Ch12_ChadRecruitsRaigh
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Raigh![N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly, Chad.[N]
What happened to the orphanage?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...I knew you'd be concerned.[AN]
You ran off, but I knew[N]
you'd never forget us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I was never concerned.[N]
I was just curious.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...The orphanage is gone.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Bern's troops burned it to the[N]
ground when they invaded Lycia.[AN]
Poppa... He couldn't...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![N]
They killed Poppa...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge him.[AN]
We're stuck on these Isles now.[AN]
But I know we'll go back and fight[N]
Bern full force some day...![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose there's no point in[N]
telling you, though, is there?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'll go with you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?![N]
Are you serious?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern has a deep connection[N]
with the dragons.[AN]
I want to learn more.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...So that's it.[N]
Fine.[AN]
Just don't get[N]
in my way.[AN][X]

## Ch12_LughRaighTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Raigh? Raigh![N]
It's so good to see you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...![N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you're OK.[N]
We were all worried about you.[AN]
I know you wanted to train your magic[N]
skills, but you left so suddenly.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I couldn't have learned magic if[N]
I'd stayed in that orphanage.[AN]
It was a miracle I picked[N]
up as much as I did.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Raigh...[N]
The orphanage is gone.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know. I heard from Chad[N]
just a moment ago.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. In fact, I've joined up[N]
with this army you're in.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You have?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I just want you to[N]
know one thing.[AN]
I'm not here to avenge[N]
Poppa or the orphanage![AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know, Raigh.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then stop looking[N]
at me like that![AN][X]

## Ch12_ChadRaighTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Raigh![N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly, Chad.[AN][Clear]
I heard from Lugh about[N]
the orphanage.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...And what did you[N]
think about that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Nothing in particular.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...So you say.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I've joined up with[N]
your army, by the way.[AN]
I want to learn more[N]
about these dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Of course you do. Fine.[AN]
But I'm here to avenge Poppa.[N]
Just don't get in my way.[AN][X]

## Ch12_End1
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That was not an easy battle...[AN]
The dragons' power is truly...[N]
horrific.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]An unhuman...[N]
Now I understand.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How many of these dragons[N]
does Bern have...?[AN]
How can we expect to be victorious[N]
against monsters like these?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy![N]
Keep a level head.[AN]
[OpenRight]Ah...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand your worries.[AN]
But if you panic, that feeling[N]
will spread to the army.[AN]
You must remember that.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...I'm sorry.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a perfectly understandable[N]
reaction after a fight like that.[AN]
But...we also gained knowledge[N]
we did not have before.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What knowledge[N]
is that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you remember?[AN]
I told you Arcardo was rumored[N]
to be working with Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that's right![AN]
If Bern's dragons are in[N]
an Etrurian castle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Arcardo has indeed made[N]
a deal with Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...That means Lycia is in danger...[AN]
We must return to the mainland.[AN]
We have to contact General[N]
Cecilia and conceive a plan...[AN][X]

## Ch12_EndGaidenGot
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, before returning to the mainland,[N]
there is a matter to take care of.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]More bandits?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, thankfully.[AN]
A legendary weapon is hidden[N]
in a cave not far from here.[AN]
If we obtain it, we can fight[N]
the dragons more effectively.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A legendary weapon... You're right![AN]
If we can get all eight of them, we[N]
might have a chance of defeating Bern![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... We must find as[N]
many as we can.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go to the[N]
cave and get it![AN][X]
