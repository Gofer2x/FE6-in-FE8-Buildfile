[OpenMidRight][LoadGuerrero][ToggleSmile]This is the end of the caaave?[AN]
Treasuuure...[N]
Where are yooouu...?[AN]
Answer meee...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid]
Boss... Are you sure[N]
about this?[AN]
The men from Bern just told[N]
us to block the entrance.[AN]
If they catch us now, they'll[N]
surely have us back in chains![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You foooool![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][AN]
[OpenRight]We'll do as we're told in tiiime...[AN]
They'll never know that we took[N]
the treasuuure...[AN]
If we block the entrance without taking[N]
the treasure, it's all the same anywaaay...[AN]
Do you really want that poor treasure[N]
trapped in here for all eternityyy?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Well, when you put it that way...[N]
I guess you're right.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan]Boss![AN]
There's an army stationed[N]
outside the cave![AN]
[OpenRight]Whaaat?[AN]
They want to take our[N]
treasure, do theeey?[AN]
Have the boys near the entrance[N]
take them ooouut...[AN]
And grab all the treasure cheeests...[N]
We rightfully stole them fiiirst![AN][X]

## Ch12x_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]A legendary weapon lies in this cave...?[AN]
It's so dark in here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]According to the scholar in[N]
Juteaux I spoke to,[AN]
the legendary weapon in this cave is[N]
most likely the Thunder Axe, Armads.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Armads...[AN]
An axe this time.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Armads was wielded by Durban the Berserker,[N]
who was said to be a colossus of a man.[AN]
A single blow from his axe surely made[N]
short work of any opponent.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Elffin, you seem to know a lot about[N]
the Eight Legends and their weapons.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a bard. It is my job[N]
to know myths and legends.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'd like to hear some of them[N]
when we have the time.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[AN]
...Lord Roy, it seems we are[N]
not alone in this cave.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We aren't?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There are also noxious fumes[N]
coming from the cave walls.[AN]
We must tread lightly.[AN][X]

## Ch12x_End1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Where is the legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[AN]
I hear wind blowing from[N]
behind the throne.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[N]
I can't hear it...[AN]
[MoveRight]A niche...between the[N]
floor and the wall.[AN][Clear]
Oh! It opened![AN][Clear]
...So this is the legendary weapon?[N]
This axe is enormous.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Armads...[AN]
The very axe wielded by[N]
Durban the Berserker.[AN]
It certainly appears fit for[N]
a warrior of his stature.[AN]
## Ch12x_[0BDE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, here it is![AN]
There's a large axe behind the[N]
throne![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]This is Armads...[N]
Durban's axe...[AN][X]
