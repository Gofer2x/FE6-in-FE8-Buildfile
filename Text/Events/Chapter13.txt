[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just this moment.[AN]
The general from Etruria[N]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, Your Majesty...[AN]
But everything will soon[N]
be under our control.[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Allow me.[N]
I will squash her myself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][FastPrint]Your Highness, there[N]
is no need...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]These arms could use some exercise.[N]
It's no bother.[AN]

## Ch13_CeciliaThrownIntoDungeon
[OpenLeft][LoadZephiel][ToggleSmile]She lost consciousness...[N]
How disappointing. I expected more.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNarcian][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty![N]
Untouchable as always![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I suppose it was foolish to expect[N]
a challenge from an Etrurian.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]If you would allow it, Your Majesty,[N]
will you leave her to me?[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Why?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]She has caused me...[N]
certain difficulties.[AN]

## Ch13_PercevalComplains
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][ToggleSmile]Bern has attacked[N]
the castle?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...This wasn't in the agreement.[AN]
They promised to leave Etrurian[N]
matters to us of Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What shall we do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Was it General Narcian who made[N]
the order to attack the castle?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, sir.[N]
It was King Zephiel himself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Really![....]
The king himself...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Then Bern never saw us as[N]
partners to begin with.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight]We will observe for now[N]
and fall back in time.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

## Ch13_CastleHasFallen
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]The castle has fallen?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[N]
We were too late.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Is General Cecilia[N]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's no report of her[N]
death, but it looks grim...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]There's still a possibility[N]
that she's alive.[AN]
We can't give up on her.[N]
We must hurry![AN][X]

So good to see you.[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Zephiel, why?[AN]
Why do you continue this war?[N]
So many innocent people have died...[AN]
[OpenRight]Innocent, you say?[AN]
Pah. Jealousy, vanity, greed...[AN]
Men kill because of these petty[N]
emotions all across the realm.[AN]
How can you say they[N]
are innocent?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I...[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]The world must be liberated from[N]
these trivial creations of man.[AN]
That is the purpose of this war.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But...so many people are being[N]
killed in the process.[AN]
[OpenRight]A few worthless lives are a fair[N]
trade for the change I desire.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Zephiel...![AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Guinivere, you are my only sister.[N]
My only surviving blood relative.[AN]

Also have her ensure the Fire Emblem[N]

do if she is freed?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I understand that Roy and the[N]
Lycian Army are nearby...[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]You would join the enemy?![AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]I cannot sit idly by and watch as the[N]
world is overrun by Bern's forces...[AN]
No matter the reason, it is[N]
senselessly violent conquest.[AN]
What kind of future will this war[N]
lead us to...?[AN]

[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Melady,[N]
I ask you to let me go.[AN]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]...There is just...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Yes?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is just one thing I[N]
wish to ask, Your Highness.[AN]
When you left Bern, why did you[N]
not ask my opinion...?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]I thought involving you would[N]
damage your reputation.[AN]
I didn't want you to be branded[N]
a traitor like me.[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Does Your Highness honestly think[N]
I would ever pay any heed to that?[AN]
I serve Your Highness before I[N]
serve Bern.[AN]
It has been so since I was[N]
knighted.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Melady...[AN]

then with pleasure, I will.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]I did![AN]
Well...I left a dragon to[N]
deal with them...[AN]
I never thought they[N]
would survive![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Disregarding your failure,[N]
my reputation is at stake![AN]
They defeated a dragon, so they[N]

Yet if I can't defeat them here,[N]
people will doubt my ability...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]General Narcian...[N]
What should we do...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]There is only one thing we CAN do...[N]

You stay here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][FastPrint]What?![AN]

Stay here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry.[N]

General Perceval?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We're leaving.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[N]
Are you sure?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's actions are an[N]

I cannot aid Bern any further.[N]
We must return to Aquileia.[AN]
I will inform General Douglas of this[N]
and plan a new course of action.[AN]
Fall back at once![AN]

## Ch13_BodyRingVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager10]
Here, take this ring.[AN]
It will build up your[N]

...It might make the ladies a[N]
little less attractive, though.[AN][X]

## Ch13_AlsSwordVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]
I thought I'd try to defend[N]
myself with this sword,[AN]
but I don't know how to use it.[AN]
It's a nice sword though,[N]
isn't it?[AN]
The last one to use it was a kid[N]
named Al.[AN]
He was a courageous one, and he[N]
stood up to Bern, just like you.[AN]
Here. I'll give it to you.[N]
Use it to end this war![AN][X]

## Ch13_ThreeGeneralsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager11]
Cecilia, Perceval, and Douglas![N]
They're the three Etrurian Generals.[AN]
Even the three Wyvern Generals[N]
of Bern are no match for them.[AN]
...That's what I'd like[N]
to think, anyway.[AN][X]

## Ch13_CeciliaDefeatedHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]

I...was too slow to act,[N]
so I was captured...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why would Bern attack a[N]

[OpenFarLeft]I do not know...[AN]
Perhaps they learned of the[N]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Dragons?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]That's right...[AN]
Arcadia was founded by both[N]
dragon and man ages ago...[AN]
