## Ch14_Start1
[OpenLeft][LoadIgrene][OpenFarRight][LoadFae]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hurry, Fae![AN]
Follow this path and[N]
find a place to hide.[AN]
Can you make it?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]I'm...[N]
I'm tired![AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Now is no time for[N]
complaints.[AN]
Go, or Bern's soldiers[N]
will find us.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]What happened[N]
to Sophia?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't know...[AN]
She may have been captured[N]
by Bern's troops.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]But if Bern catches us, then[N]
we can see the outside world![AN]
[OpenLeft]Fae, no.[AN]
The elder strictly forbids[N]
communication with the outside world.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][NormalPrint]Aw...[N]
Please?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[AN]
...I do wonder how Bern found[N]
out about our village, however...[AN]
Perhaps it is related to the ominous[N]
force Sophia detected in the soldiers...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]What?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Ah, sorry![AN]
Now is not the time[N]
for that![AN]
Fae! Over here![N]
Hurry![AN]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...I want to see the[N]
outside world, too.[AN][X]

## Ch14_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRandy][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Zeiss![N]
Has General Narcian arrived yet?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]He sent some sellswords and dragons,[N]
but the general himself isn't here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What on earth is he thinking?[AN]
How does he expect these sparse troops[N]
to tip the odds in our favor...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]King Zephiel must be notified about[N]
the dragons living here.[AN]
Zeiss, go to Aquileia and make[N]
a report to His Majesty.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What should I say?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell him that dragons do indeed inhabit[N]
this village.[AN]
A captive tells us there are even divine[N]
dragons, the most powerful of all.[AN]
...Go quickly.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch14_Start3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is a fierce sandstorm.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes... These sandstorms have always[N]
protected our village from intruders.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I can imagine that most who wander into[N]
this mess would give up quickly.[AN]
I can barely see an arm's length ahead...[AN]
In which direction do we move?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Head to the northeast...[N]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There may be objects covered by the[N]
sand, blown about by the storm...[AN]
Please watch your step...[AN][X]

## Ch14_BanditsAppear
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMaggie][OpenFarRight][LoadRose]
[ToggleSmile]Maggie, my sweet, did you see that[N]
group heading right into the desert?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, Rose, I most certainly did.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
They must be headed for the hidden[N]
village said to be near here, Maggie.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Bless my soul, Rose.[N]
I believe you may be correct.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]But my sweet Maggie, we wouldn't want to[N]
get lost in the sandstorm, would we?[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Of course not, Rose.[AN]
Then we wouldn't be able to[N]
find our way home.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Do you think we should give up[N]
on the village then, Maggie?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, you forget the rumors say[N]
there is great treasure in the village.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]Well, we certainly wouldn't want to[N]
miss out on that, would we, Maggie?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course not, Rose.[AN]
It would make us far richer than[N]
ambushing travelers has.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveFarRight]But I don't want to[N]
get lost, Maggie.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, hear me out.[AN]
We need only follow closely behind the[N]
group we saw heading into the desert.[AN]
That will ensure they lead us right[N]
to the village.[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What a wonderful idea, Maggie.[AN]
And once we reach the village, we can[N]
thank them by mashing their heads in.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Marvelous, my dear Rose.[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]Let's be off then.[N]
Shall we, Maggie?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Why certainly,[N]
my dear Rose.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Then let's waste no time,[N]
my sweet Maggie.[AN][X]

## Ch14_GaidenGone1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]The sandstorm...[N]
It stopped.[AN]
[OpenLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]This is our chance, Lord Roy![N]
The village is in clear sight now![AN]
[OpenMidRight]But it is to the enemy, too.[N]
We must hurry![AN][X]

## Ch14_GaidenGone2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadRandy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Randy, we have finished[N]
searching the village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Did you find the[N]
legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No...[AN]
But we destroyed all the passageways[N]
we suspected might lead to it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good work.[AN]
Now all that's left is to[N]
stop the Lycian Army.[AN][X]

## Ch14_SophiaFindsGuidingRing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia]
Something...is glittering[N]
in the sand...[.....] Oh...[AN][Clear]
What a beautiful ring...[AN][X]

## Ch14_DelphiHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
Have you heard of the sky god, Delphi?[AN]
He is said to race through the skies[N]
and protect all living things.[AN]
They say that with his blessing,[AN]
wyvern riders and pegasus knights[N]
can fly freely without danger...[AN][X]

## Ch14_BonesTreasureHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager23]
There are a lot of things[N]
buried in the sand.[AN]
If you're really lucky, you might[N]
find something good.[AN]
Try looking around the bones.[AN][X]

## Ch14_EndGaidenGot
[OpenFarRight][LoadSophia][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]That was a difficult battle...[N]
but we won.[AN]
Sophia, where are[N]
the villagers?[AN][Clear]
Sophia, are you OK?[N]
What's wrong?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]...The entrance to the temple...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]This door...?[AN]
It looks like it's been[N]
forced open.[AN]
What lies inside the temple?[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Something we call a[N]
legendary weapon...[AN]
It is a spell tome...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]A legendary weapon?![N]
There's one here, too?![AN]
...That must be[N]
what Bern was after![AN]
Are we too late?[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]It is still here...[N]
I can sense it...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadRoy][FastPrint]All right![N]
Then let's get it![AN][Clear]
We may still be able[N]
to stop Bern![AN][X]
