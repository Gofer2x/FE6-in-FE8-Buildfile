[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadOates][ToggleSmile]Haven't you found the[N]
legendary weapon yet?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We believe it is inside this[N]
altar, but we can't get it open...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Break it open if you have to![N]
It doesn't matter![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]The enemy has already entered the temple,[N]
so the men are all preparing for battle![AN]
We don't have the manpower to break it[N]
open right now![AN]
[OpenRight]Blasted distractions...[N]
We don't have time for this.[AN]
As soon as the enemy is defeated, locating[N]
the weapon is our highest priority.[AN][X]

## Ch14x_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is what it looks like[N]
under the desert?[AN]
There's so much...water.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia]This is close to a source[N]
of groundwater...[AN]
This is the reason plants and animals[N]
can live in our village...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So this is the source[N]
of the oasis.[AN]
Still, how did you find such[N]
an ideal location?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Athos...[AN]
Archsage Athos[N]
led us here...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You mean the Athos of the[N]
Eight Legends?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[AN]
After the Scouring...Archsage Athos[N]
traveled all across Elibe...[AN]
At the end of his journey, he discovered[N]
our village of both man and dragon...[AN]
He told us it was only a matter of time[N]
until we were discovered...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So he brought you into the desert[N]
where you could stay hidden...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... He concealed his legendary[N]
weapon within this temple...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Will your village permit us to[N]
use this legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The Archsage said that we were to[N]
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...[AN]
As long as you use it...to save Elibe[N]
and to protect us...then of course...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It will be invaluable.[N]
Thank you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Some of the pathways in this temple[N]
will sink into the water without warning...[AN]
Please be careful...[AN][X]

## Ch14x_EndSophiaAlive
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is here...[N]
Inside this altar...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
It won't open...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Only those of the village[N]
may open the altar...[AN]
Please allow me...[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]There...[N]
This is the legendary weapon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Athos used this?[N]
Then it's...[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes... It is the Infernal Truth.[N]
Forblaze...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The tome appears to be inside[N]
the altar, Lord Roy.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Can you get it out?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I sent some people to ask the[N]
villagers about it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, but let's not[N]
force the issue.[AN]
If they will not give us permission to[N]
use it, then we leave it here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[AN][ClearFace][X]

## Ch14x_EndSophiaDead2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![AN]
The villagers helped us remove[N]
the tome from the altar![AN]
Here it is.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]
...If this is what Archsage Athos used, it[N]
must be Forblaze, the Infernal Truth.[AN]
The legends say that none could[N]
escape its fiery punishment.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...We must use it[N]
cautiously then.[AN][X]
