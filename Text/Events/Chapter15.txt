## Ch15_Start1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadRaith]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Commander Raith, I have an update on[N]
the girl we captured...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Girl?[AN]
The one that was scurrying[N]
around outside the castle?[AN]
[MoveRight]I distinctly recall telling[N]
you to throw her out![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]But sir, she was[N]
carrying this.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]Is this...a dragonstone?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...I believe so.[AN]
[OpenRight]Do you know what this[N]
is used for?[AN]
[OpenLeft]I saw ones like it in the invasion of Lycia.[AN]
The manaketes that joined us carried[N]
them when they were in human form.[AN]
[OpenRight]...This one does look a tad different from[N]
the other dragonstones I've seen.[AN]
Still, the possibility that she is[N]
a dragon cannot be ignored.[AN]
We should inform King Zephiel and[N]
await further orders.[AN]
Keep the girl inside the castle![AN][X]

## Ch15_Start2
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Fae has been taken[N]
to that castle?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]That's what the[N]
locals told me.[AN][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIgrene]Roy, I apologize...[AN]
This is my fault for not[N]
considering what Fae might do.[AN]
We have no time for this rescue.[N]
We must hurry to Aquileia.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]This is nobody's fault.[AN]
If Bern gets their hands on her,[N]
it could be catastrophic.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]She should be safe as long as she remains[N]
in human form and hides her dragonstone.[AN]
[OpenRight]Dragonstone?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]When dragons are in human form, they[N]
seal their power into dragonstones.[AN]
Dragons use vast amounts of energy[N]
to maintain their true shape,[AN]
so most remain in human form to[N]
minimize the stress on their bodies.[AN]
[OpenRight]That must be what the unhumans[N]
with Bern do as well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]From what you have told me,[N]
that seems most likely.[AN]
Dragons have apparently been taking human[N]
form since the end of the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenRight]For that long...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy, the spy we sent[N]
to the castle has returned.[AN]
[OpenRight]What did he find out?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Many soldiers are coming[N]
out of the castle.[AN]
They seem to be fortifying[N]
their defenses.[AN]
[OpenRight]They must have discovered[N]
that Fae is a dragon...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The troops on the border[N]
seem to have noticed us.[AN]
[OpenRight]Then we must move quickly.[AN][X]

## Ch15_Start3
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perceval,[N]
you don't have to do this.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry about me, Sir Douglas.[N]
You must return to King Mordred.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But attacking the Lycian Army...?[N]
It is pointless.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Roartz only wants me out of[N]
the capital.[AN]
He's worried I'll stab him in the[N]
back when he isn't looking.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That man, worrying about traitors?[.....]
Hah![AN]
Why, he was the first to betray[N]
his loyalty to the king![AN]
Truly a snake if I ever met one.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No one's loyalty to Etruria can[N]
compare to yours, Sir Douglas.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Rubbish.[N]
Just look at yourself.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...When Prince Myrddin still lived,[N]
I never hesitated to fulfill his will.[AN]
I believed I could dedicate my life[N]
to him and the good of Etruria.[AN]
My actions now protect the king's life,[N]
and yet...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You hesitate?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Frankly, yes.[N]
It feels meaningless.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Perceval, I want you to listen to me.[N]
Don't respond. Let it sink in.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria...[....]will fall along with the[N]
king before this war ends.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No matter what happens,[N]
I will stay by the king's side.[AN]
But you, Perceval, are of a different breed.[N]
You must lead the Etruria of tomorrow.[AN]
Despite the impending collapse, I firmly[N]
believe Etruria will prosper once more.[AN]
Perceval, you must leave Etruria for[N]
now and await your time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Sir Douglas![N]
What do--[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadSoldier2]General Perceval![AN]
The Lycian Army[N]
stands dead ahead![AN]
What are your orders, sir?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Go! I will return[N]
to Aquileia.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...Move forth![N]
Pursue the Lycian Army![AN][X]

## Ch15_GarretAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is a[N]
battlefield...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What do we do, Boss?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The armies are gonna loot the villages.[N]
We better get to 'em first.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]All right, Boss![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just don't hurt anybody who[N]
isn't askin' for it. Got it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yeah, yeah...[AN][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's too nice for his own good...[AN]
If anything happens to the villagers,[N]
we can just say the armies did it.[AN][X]

## Ch15_ReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidRight][LoadRaith][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft]Commander Raith,[N]
the reinforcements are ready![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent.[N]
Deploy them now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch15_ElffinRecruitsPerceval
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadElffin]
[OpenMidRight]Perceval.[N]
It is good to see you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...!![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you forgotten my face?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No... I could never.[N]
But it cannot be...[AN]
The prince...is dead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I understand your confusion.[AN]
A man who was declared dead[N]
stands before your very eyes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin![N]
It is you...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry to have put you[N]
through such trouble.[AN]
...It has already been over a year[N]
since the attempt on my life.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Attempt on your life?![AN]
I thought Your Highness fell[N]
off his horse in an accident.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I was hit with[N]
poisoned darts.[AN]
One to my horse...[N]
and one to myself...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Douglas was the first to notice and[N]
made it public that I had died.[AN]
A look-alike corpse was placed[N]
in my coffin.[AN]
It was all an act to make it appear that[N]
the assassination had been successful.[AN]
Douglas entrusted me to his daughter[N]
and had me escape to the Western Isles.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Douglas knew[N]
all this time...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Even after I escaped west, the poison[N]
had me ill for many months.[AN]
I drifted between life and death for so long[N]
that Douglas' daughter nearly lost hope.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenMidRight]The resistance force nursed me[N]
back to health.[AN]
Ironic, isn't it?[AN]
The resistance, enemy of the nobility,[N]
saved the life of the prince of Etruria![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]My recovery...was slow.[AN]
I saw the crimes committed by[N]
Etrurian nobles firsthand.[AN]
I felt so ashamed that I had never[N]
noticed while I was on the throne.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Your Highness...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]As I aided the resistance, I waited for[N]
my chance to return to the mainland.[AN]
Then along came Roy,[N]
and I knew it was time.[AN]
That is how I ended up here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My prince...[AN]
I am thankful beyond words[N]
that you are alive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am now with the Lycian Army,[N]
and my identity must remain hidden.[AN]
However, if I still have the loyalty[N]
you pledged to me in the past...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Until the day I die,[N]
my prince.[AN]
I have only one master, and it[N]
is you, Prince Myrddin.[AN][X]

## Ch15_LarumRecruitsPerceval
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Perceval![AN]
It is you, isn't it?[N]
I've been looking for you![AN]
I am...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]
[ToggleSmile]Wait! Wait![N]
Stop![AN]
Listen to me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Who are you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You don't remember?![N]
We met before.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think I recall seeing you[N]
at Douglas's manor.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![N]
That's me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But the girl I met then was[N]
far less...garish.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?[N]
Ah, never mind.[AN][ToggleSmile]
My name is Larum.[AN]
I'm here on the orders[N]
of Prince Myrddin.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin...?[N]
Don't be daft.[AN]
The prince passed away in[N]
an accident over a year ago.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well...[N]
Look at this![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That emblem...!![N]
It belonged to the prince...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now do I have your attention?[N]
Look at this letter, too.[AN]
The prince told me to give[N]
it to you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
His Highness's handwriting...[N]
He lives![AN]
I hesitate no more.[AN]
If the prince is in the Lycian Army,[N]
then I am as well.[AN]
[ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wha--?[N]
That was quick...[AN]
I was hoping things would get[N]
a little more dramatic...[AN]
Like, "If you want my skill,[N]
you'll have to best me first!"[AN]
Oh well. This works too.[AN][X]

## Ch15_LilinaRecruitsGarret
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Wait![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?[N]
Who are you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Why are you attacking[N]
the villages?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Excuse me?[N]
Who d'you think you are?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I asked you a question.[AN]
Tell me why you're[N]
attacking the villages![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]"Why?"[N]
I guess it's yer fault, really.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Our fault?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep.[AN]
You idiots make war, and poor folk like[N]
me resort to raidin' to survive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We fight to help[N]
people like you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]D'you know how many[N]
times I've heard that?[AN]
This is reality, kid.[AN]
You all say yer tryin' to help, but[N]
it's all hot air and empty promises.[AN]
If yer gonna say somethin' like[N]
that, then prove it.[AN]
You don't even know what's goin' on.[N]
Now get outta my way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...No.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Listen, I ain't playin' games[N]
with you.[AN]
If ya don't get outta here, I'll[N]
do somethin' we'll both regret...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I won't move.[N]
Kill me if you will.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If I let you pass, then I too have[N]
said nothing but hot air.[AN]
I tell the truth![N]
We fight to help the people.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Heh heh... You...[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I've never met anyone[N]
so naive as you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you...[N]
laugh at me...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Still, you've moved this old[N]
raider's heart.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Does that mean...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yep. You win.[N]
I'll stop lootin'.[AN]
But let me fight with you.[AN]
Show me firsthand that yer[N]
true to yer words.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[AN]
After being with us for a while,[N]
I'm positive you will understand.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ya certainly[N]
seem confident at least.[AN]
I'm Garrett.[N]
And you are...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina?[AN]
It's a pleasure to make yer[N]
acquaintance, milady.[AN][X]

## Ch15_PercevalRoyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]General Perceval![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Roy.[AN]
I wish to join your cause.[N]
Will you accept me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Absolutely![AN]
We're honored to have[N]
someone of your ability.[AN]
But why the sudden[N]
change of heart?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Must I answer[N]
that question?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I won't force you if you[N]
have reason not to tell.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive me.[AN]
I shall tell you[N]
when the time comes.[AN][X]

## Ch15_DivineVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[ToggleSmile]A little girl was taken[N]
to the castle...[AN]
Here, I'll give you this.[N]
Please rescue her.[AN]
Our priest always had[N]
this tome with him.[AN]
...He was taken to the castle,[N]
too, but he never returned.[AN][X]

## Ch15_HammerneVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
This is a Hammerne staff.[AN]
It can repair your weapons,[N]
spell tomes, and staves.[AN]
Just about the only thing it[N]
can't repair is itself.[AN]
It'll wear down every time you[N]
use it, so wield it wisely.[AN][X]

## Ch15_SavageBanditsHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]
I've been hearing about[N]
bandits in this area.[AN]
I bet they're all[N]
savage killers.[AN]
They probably have no[N]
conscience at all.[AN][X]

## Ch15_GeneralsDividedHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
The rumors say that the three Generals[N]
of Etruria have been divided...[AN]
But so have the hearts of[N]
the people.[AN]
I only hope they don't have to[N]
fight against each other...[AN][X]

## Ch15_End
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![N]
Here she is![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]You found her?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I believe you owe Lord Roy[N]
a thank you, young lady.[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenLeft][LoadFae][FastPrint]...Sniff...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Easy, Merlinus.[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...Why did you follow us?[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I just wanted to see[N]
the outside world...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]You put yourself in danger[N]
for such a trivial reason?![AN]
Do you know how much[N]
trouble you've caused?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]But...but...[N]
[MoveLeft]I'm never, ever allowed outside![AN]
The elder says I have to[N]
remain hidden...[AN]
I'm always alone...[N]
locked up in my room...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Lord Roy,[N]
what shall we do?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...You could have been killed.[AN]
Do you understand how much worry[N]
and trouble you've caused?[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yes...[N]
I'm sorry...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Truly?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes... Sniff...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All things considered, I think we have[N]
no choice but to take you with us.[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]Really?![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy might already know[N]
about her now.[AN]
If that's true, she'll be safer with us[N]
than returning unguarded to Arcadia.[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hurray![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Hush! This isn't[N]
cause for celebration.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You mustn't run off[N]
alone anymore.[AN]
Do you promise?[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Yes![N]
I pinky swear![AN][X]
