Curses! A thousand curses...![N]
The Lycian Army still stands![AN]
How have they come so far?![AN]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier2]G-General Narcian...[AN]
Head Wyvern General Murdock[N]
is here![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]He is?![AN]
Th-then posthaste![N]
Send an escort![AN]
Ensure he receives[N]
every hospitality...[AN]
[OpenRight]He is already here...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMurdock]Yes. Enough.[N]
Step aside.[OpenRight][ClearFace][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]S-Sir Murdock...[N]
What a pleasant surprise![AN]
What brings you all the[N]
way from Ilia?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Enough of your squirrelly[N]
pleasantries, Narcian.[AN]
I want an explanation for[N]
this embarrassment.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Murdock...[AN]
I don't believe I understand...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
Then allow me to explain.[N]
Princess Guinivere has escaped yet again.[AN]
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed[N]
in the Western Isles and is dead.[AN]
And finally, perhaps most[N]
egregious of all,[AN]
you have neglected your mission to[N]
capture the village in Nabata,[AN]
despite specific orders directly[N]
from King Zephiel's mouth![AN][Clear]
This is inexcusable, Narcian![N]
Explain yourself![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Oh, th-that...[AN]
Well, you see, there have been many[N]
complications, so I took it upon myself to--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hold your tongue.[N]
That's enough.[AN]
I've orders from the king.[AN]
I am to revoke your title[N]
of Wyvern General.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]What?![AN]
[OpenMidRight]You are to be[N]
replaced by Galle.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Sir Murdock![N]
Please wait![AN]
Allow me one more chance!![AN]
[OpenMidRight]...The Lycian Army[N]
approaches fast.[AN]
Show your worth and[N]
stop them in their tracks.[AN]
If you succeed, perhaps the[N]
king will reconsider.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Murdock...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Narcian...[AN]
Don't fail the king,[....]
or me,[....] again.[AN][X]

## Ch16_Start2
[OpenFarRight][LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]Balderdash![N]
A demotion?![AN]
And I'm to be replaced by Galle[N]
of all people...![AN]
Never![N]
I will not allow it![AN]
B-but what is left for[N]
me to do...? No...![AN]
My status and reputation...[N]
Everything is crumbling down![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint]General Narcian,[N]
the enemy draws near...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Silence![N]
I know that already.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Wait.[AN]
Melady's younger brother is[N]
stationed in this castle...[AN]
And Melady's the one who[N]
helped the princess escape![AN]
Ah-ha![AN]
I can say he was leaking information[N]
to the enemy! What a flawless plan![AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm hm hm hm...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, General Narcian...[N]
What was that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Hm?[AN]
Oh. You know Melady's[N]
younger brother, don't you?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You mean Sir Zeiss?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]That's him. Zeiss.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I have reason to suspect he's leaking[N]
information to the Lycian Army.[AN]
Bring him here.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]What?![AN]
I can't believe that Sir Zeiss[N]
would ever do such a thing...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, yes, it's shocking! I know![N]
Now shut your trap![AN]
Do as you're told and[N]
bring him before me![AN][X]

## Ch16_Start3
[OpenRight][LoadArcardo][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Th-the enemy is[N]

[OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Oh... What can we do?[AN]
If we're captured, we will[N]
be tried as traitors![AN]

[OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadRoartz][OpenRight][LoadArcardo]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]...Arcardo! This is all your fault![AN]
If you had eliminated the Lycian Army at[N]
the Isles as you were supposed to...[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]B-but Lord Roartz...![N]
...No![AN]
This is neither the time nor[N]
place to argue, my lord![AN]
We must make our[N]
escape quickly![AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]But escape to where...?[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]...Let us turn to Bern![AN]
This plot originated from[N]
them to begin with...[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, of course![AN]
We have proven[N]
ourselves useful.[AN]
They're sure to offer us[N]
suitable positions.[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][FastPrint]...And what do you intend[N]
to do with the king?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Er... Well, Bern will probably see[N]
that no harm comes to him.[AN]
King Zephiel's mother was[N]
Etrurian, after all.[AN]
Douglas, I suggest[N]
you flee as well...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]And I suggest you shut your mouth.[AN]
I only fought alongside you because[N]
King Mordred's life was at stake.[AN]
I do not intend to go along with[N]
your scheme to the end.[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Hmph! Unbending as always.[N]
Suit yourself.[AN]
Arcardo, we escape now![AN]

## Ch16_Start4
[OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][ToggleSmile]...Dirty traitors![AN]
[ToggleSmile]Fleeing with their tails[N]
between their legs...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I can't imagine it took much for[N]
Bern to seduce them.[AN]
They'll meet their end at the hands[N]
of the Lycian Army before long...[AN][Clear]
When Prince Myrddin returns...[N]
Etruria will be whole again.[AN]
But until then...I shall continue[N]
to fight for the king.[AN]
My loyalty and honor as Great General[N]
depend upon it![AN][X]

## Ch16_Start5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is Castle Aquileia, Lord Roy.[AN]
Our information says that the[N]
revolutionaries are stationed inside.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I thank you for your help,[N]
Father Yoder.[AN]
Thanks to the church, we were able[N]
to avoid a battle in the city.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is I who must[N]
thank you.[AN]
The church has been persecuted[N]
by the revolutionaries.[AN]
Were it not for you, we would have[N]
been forced out already.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Persecuted?[N]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I can only presume it is because of our[N]
investigation into Bern's dragons.[AN]
Before she ascended to heaven, our founder,[N]
Saint Elimine, said these words:[AN]
"Allow not dragons to return to this realm,[N]
for that would bring suffering to many."[AN]
That's why we must do everything we can[N]
to send the dragons back to their world.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...The revolutionaries are with Bern, so that[N]
explains the persecution of the church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]We have discovered something[N]
interesting as well.[AN]
The return of the dragons is tied to the[N]
Fire Emblem, Bern's greatest treasure.[AN]
We don't yet know how, so that's why I[N]
sent Saul and Dorothy to investigate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hmm.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy, you must stop[N]
the revolutionaries.[AN]
If you would allow me to give[N]
you one more piece of advice,[AN][SendToBack]
try talking to some of the troops.[AN]
I'm certain many of them were forced[N]
into the army against their will.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[N]
Thank you again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Saint Elimine's blessings upon you,[N]
Lord Roy.[AN][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadGalle][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeiss][CloseSpeechFast]I'm here, Sir Galle.[N]
Is something wrong?[AN]
Why did you summon me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Zeiss, you must hide.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you mean?[N]
The enemy is before us![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Listen to me.[AN]
General Narcian has given the order[N]
for you to be taken prisoner.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![AN]
Does he think that[N]
I have betrayed Bern?![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He needs a scapegoat for[N]
his failures.[AN]
He says that you worked with Melady[N]
to leak information to the enemy.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]With my sister?[N]
I don't even know where she is.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Melady has apparently joined the[N]
Lycian Army alongside the princess.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Melady turned to the enemy?![N]
I don't believe it for a second...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ask her yourself.[N]
She is apparently here.[AN]
Would that I could go with you,[AN]
but General Murdock ordered me to[N]
observe the outcome of the battle.[AN]
Zeiss, get out while you still can.[N]
Talk to Melady.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Sir Galle![N]

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will not make a move until[N]
I hear Melady's story.[AN][ClearFace][X]

This is the most extravagant[N]
palace in Elibe...[AN]
I bet the treasure's nothing to[N]
sneeze at, either.[AN]
It was all taken from people like me[N]
anyway, so I'm just reclaiming it![AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Cecilia.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Douglas...[AN]
Why is someone of your stature[N]
fighting for the revolutionaries...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]The king's safety takes[N]
priority over all.[AN]
There is nothing more to[N]
it than that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If this continues, Etruria will[N]
become a mere puppet of Bern![AN]
The king must have dominion over[N]
this nation for us to serve him.[AN]
The path you are on will only[N]
lead to Etruria's destruction![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]If the nation is doomed to[N]
collapse, then so be it.[AN]
But I will ensure the[N]
king's safety![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?![AN]
Our loyalty is to our people,[N]
to our nation![AN]
The Etrurian Army exists for[N]
the people.[AN]
The soldiers are not the king's[N]
personal bodyguards![AN]

I have always served Princess Guinivere.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You threw away everything...[N]

Even your beloved Galle...[N]

For that...obstinate princess[N]
