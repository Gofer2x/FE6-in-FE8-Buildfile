[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadWindham][ToggleSmile]Lord Roartz fled?![AN]
What of me?! I betrayed the church and[N]
took control of this tower on his order![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roartz's message said he leaves[N]
us to fend for ourselves.[AN]
Because we were unable to bend the church[N]
to his side, he has no more use for us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
This is all Yoder's fault. If he hadn't[N]
meddled in my affairs...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I agree...but that's the least[N]
of our worries right now...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Very well...[N]
Then this is our last stand.[AN]
If we are to die, then the Lycian[N]
Army shall fall along with us![AN]
Prepare the Heavenly Arrows![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But sir, we'll be unable to avoid[N]
hitting our own men as well![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You know the consequences for dissent.[N]
You shall do as I say![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...They'll regret crossing me...[N]
Heh heh heh...![AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is the Saint's Tower.[AN]
Saint Elimine's legendary weapon, the[N]
Aureola spell tome, lies within.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Sir Douglas.[N]
I appreciate your help.[AN]
Especially because we were fighting[N]
on opposite sides earlier...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You need not thank me.[AN]
I do as my king commands.[N]
There is nothing more to it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
That said, you saved Etruria. I am[N]
honored to fight alongside you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,[N]
I think we've found the tome.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas,[N]
is this it...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas]Yes, it is.[AN]
This is the Glorious Ascension,[N]
Aureola, Saint Elimine's weapon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]May we make[N]
use of it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The king said to take anything in[N]
the tower that may be of use.[AN]
The St. Elimine Church[N]
backs us as well.[AN]
If any oppose our use of it,[N]
then I will negotiate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,[N]
Sir Douglas.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,[N]
I think we've found the tome.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...This must be Aureola,[N]
the Glorious Ascension.[AN]
Merlinus,[AN][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to give this back[N]
to the St. Elimine Church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[AN]
The king said we could take anything[N]
we found in the tower.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is a holy relic of[N]
their order.[AN]
It would be sacrilegious to use it[N]
without their permission.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Father Yoder?[N]
What is wrong?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand you found[N]
the Aureola tome...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes.[AN]
I will return it to the[N]
church immediately.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need.[N]
We want you to take it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you certain?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What Saint Elimine wished[N]
for was peace.[AN]
Use it well and bring an[N]
end to this war.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If you insist.[AN][X]
