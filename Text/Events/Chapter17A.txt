Narcian has fallen then.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So it seems.[AN]
General Murdock, I still feel uncomfortable[N]
that we didn't go to his aid.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The king's orders explicitly[N]
said to leave him on his own.[AN]
Bern's army has no use for a man[N]
who cannot manage his own messes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Sir Murdock...[N]
What will you have us do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Arcardo, I leave Castle Remi[N]
to you.[AN]
Roartz, you will take[N]
Castle Edessa.[AN]
Make preparations to defend[N]
against the enemy.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
What?![N]
Remi is right on the border![AN]
The enemy will be here[N]
in short time![AN]
[OpenMidRight]That much is true.[AN]
But this position gives us an invaluable[N]
strategic advantage against Etruria.[AN]
You must ensure that this castle does[N]
not fall into enemy hands.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Edessa lies all the way in[N]
the outer tundra of Ilia...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, so you will have ample time[N]
to prepare your defenses.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
...You...intend only to[N]
take the defensive?[AN]
You don't mean to[N]
take back Etruria?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We play the waiting game for now.[N]
We will take Etruria some day.[AN]
And once we do, it will[N]
be under Bern's jurisdiction.[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]
What about us?! That's not[N]
what we agreed upon![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Then perhaps you should find[N]
a way to make yourself useful.[AN]
You have done nothing to[N]
deserve such renumeration.[AN][Clear]
If you'll excuse us.[AN]

## Ch17A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMurdock]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Those two will surely be killed.[N]
Should we really leave them?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
If they fall, it is because of their own[N]
incompetence.[AN]
Our army's code states that every officer[N]
must be capable and self-sufficient.[AN]
Perhaps they should have considered that[N]
before joining us...[AN][Clear]
The enemy leader... Roy, was it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Roy of Pherae.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I admit he has rebuilt the[N]
Lycian Army magnificently.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I thought it finished after[N]
we crushed it the first time...[AN]
I hope to cross blades with him[N]
before the war is over.[AN][X]

## Ch17A_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]We will soon approach[N]
the Etrurian border.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for everything,[N]
Father Yoder.[AN]
We've only made it this far thanks[N]
to the assistance of the church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I am only repaying your favor.[AN]
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would[N]
suffer great persecution from Bern.[AN]
This is nothing compared to what you[N]
did for us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It was my pleasure to[N]
help the church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
If I may be so bold...[N]
Can I ask one more favor?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course,[N]
if I am capable.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]If you discover anything[N]
else about the dragons...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Say no more.[AN]
If I find anything new, I will[N]
report to you immediately.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have my eternal thanks.[AN][ToggleSmile]
...Oh yes, I have some information[N]
that may be of use.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,[N]
exposing a crossable sandbar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]A sandbar?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It would take much time to make your[N]
way around the bay to the castle.[AN]
However, crossing the sandbar would[N]
be a direct journey.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]I'll bear it in mind.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]However you choose to proceed,[N]
please be careful.[AN]
Rushing forward has its[N]
dangers as well.[AN]
[OpenRight]Thank you for your advice.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Not at all.[AN]
May the Etrurian Army go with[N]
Saint Elimine's blessing.[AN][X]

## Ch17A_OceanPathAppears1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadArcardo]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo![N]
A path has appeared in the sea![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
According to the locals, the tide[N]
pulls out this time of day...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And you didn't know[N]
about this sooner?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Milord, we are foreigners here![N]
We do not know this land![AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]Curses![AN]
Charge! Don't allow the[N]
enemy to cross that path![AN][X]

## Ch17A_OceanPathAppears2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,[N]
we have a report.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Did the sandbar appear?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, Father Yoder[N]
was right.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Did the enemy[N]
know about it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Actually, no. They seem to[N]
be in a panicked state.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]
All right, then let's not[N]
waste this opportunity![AN]
Move forward![AN][X]

## Ch17A_TinasStaffVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager54]
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?[N]
Then please take this staff.[AN]
It was once used by the noble[N]
Lady Tina...[AN][X]

## Ch17A_SandbarHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49]
Did you know that at a[N]
certain time of day,[AN]
a sandbar appears[N]
in the bay?[AN]
It's a path right[N]
through the ocean.[AN]
Good luck![AN][X]

## Ch17A_BoatHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager55]
The tide is very dramatic[N]
around here.[AN]
I remember once I was getting[N]
ready to go fishing,[AN]
but by the time I had my boat ready,[N]
the tide had already gone out.[AN][X]


## Ch17A_End
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarRight][SendToBack][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo...[AN]
What a pathetic ending for[N]
one of his stature.[AN]
[OpenRight][SendToBack]
A year ago I myself never imagined[N]
I would be leading an army.[AN]
Fate can be unpredictable...[AN]
Perhaps we'll even be able to[N]
turn the tides against Bern.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleMouthMove]...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Lord Roy, what is that[N]
in your hand?[AN]
[OpenRight]Oh, this?[N]
It's the Fire Emblem.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That tiny gemstone...?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Princess Guinivere wanted me[N]
to keep it.[AN]
It seemed...difficult for her[N]
to give it to me...[AN]
I think she still hoped to end[N]
the war with diplomacy...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,[N]
even if that seems unlikely.[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why do you say that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Because Zephiel is the[N]
treacherous king of Bern![AN]
It is said that he murdered[N]
his own father.[AN]
I don't expect he would be[N]
moved by family trust...[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]
He killed his own father?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?[AN]
Zephiel took the throne because[N]
his father, King Desmond, passed on.[AN]
But King Desmond's death was[N]
very sudden.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]So there are rumors...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinivere[N]
know about this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure she is at least[N]
aware of the rumors.[AN]
She may even know the[N]
whole story.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]
