...Then Narcian fell at Aquileia.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milady.[N]
We've received confirmation.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Lady Brunnya...[N]
What will you have us do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You have our protection,[N]
Lord Roartz.[AN]
You have helped us so much already.[N]
We shall not neglect you.[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I thank you...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Arcardo, I assign you to[N]
defend this land of Talas.[AN]
Lord Roartz, your post will be[N]
the city of Bulgar.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Talas?! Here?![AN]
But this is so close to Aquileia.[N]
The enemy draws near![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Then stop them in their tracks.[AN]
This region's proximity to Aquileia[N]
makes it strategically invaluable.[AN]
It would be an ideal base of operations[N]
if the enemy can be repelled.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]That much is true...[AN]
[OpenLeft]Bulgar...lies deep within Sacae.[AN]
I hear there is great unrest[N]
among the nomads...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Force them into submission.[N]
That is your specialty, is it not?[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose, but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rumor says that Roy, commander of[N]
the attacking army, is but a boy.[AN]
Even so, he has led his army to victory[N]
through countless skirmishes and traps.[AN]
Under his guidance, the Lycian Army[N]
has been rebuilt stronger than ever.[AN]
He has gone through greater hardships[N]
than you, yet you complain?[AN]
Do you intend to lose to a child?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I must be off.[N]
I pray for your success.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

## Ch17B_Start2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]...Are you certain we should leave them?[N]
They will surely fall.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
They are disgraceful cowards who cast[N]
away their homeland to save their necks.[AN]
We owe them nothing. They should be grateful[N]
to receive the few troops they have.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

## Ch17B_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]We will soon approach[N]
the Etrurian border.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for everything,[N]
Father Yoder.[AN]
We've only made it this far thanks[N]
to the assistance of the church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I am only repaying your favor.[AN]
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would[N]
suffer great persecution from Bern.[AN]
This is nothing compared to what you[N]
did for us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It was my pleasure to[N]
help the church.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]If I may be so bold...[N]
Can I ask one more favor?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course,[N]
if I am capable.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]If you discover anything[N]
else about the dragons...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Say no more.[AN]
If I find anything new, I will[N]
report to you immediately.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have my eternal thanks.[AN][ToggleSmile]
...Oh yes, one word of[N]
caution before you go.[AN]
The lands around here...[AN]
They are surrounded by[N]
high mountains and hills.[AN]
It is also difficult to see[N]
in the dark of the night...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]These are ideal conditions[N]
for an ambush...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[AN]
Castle Talas up ahead[N]
is under Bern's control.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'll bear that in mind.[N]
Thank you for the advice.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Not at all.[AN]
May the Etrurian Army go with[N]
Saint Elimine's blessing.[AN][X]

## Ch17B_TinasStaffVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadSacaeanVillager]
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?[N]
Then please take this staff.[AN]
It was once used by the noble[N]
Lady Tina...[AN][X]

## Ch17B_EclipseVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager31]
We don't get many visitors[N]
up here...[AN][Clear]
What?[AN]
The enemy is planning to[N]
attack our village?[AN]
I'll make sure everyone[N]
knows...[AN]
I must thank you for[N]
telling us.[AN]
Please take this.[AN][X]

## Ch17B_NorthEastVillageHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager33]
I hear there's a village[N]
far to the northeast.[AN]
I've never met anyone[N]
who's been that far.[AN]
I wonder if anyone still[N]
lives there.[AN][X]

## Ch17B_ThievesHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager27]
I saw some shady-looking[N]
people in Bern's ranks.[AN]
Probably thieves.[AN]
You should tell the villagers[N]
before they get ransacked.[AN][X]

## Ch17B_End
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarRight][SendToBack][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo...[AN]
What a pathetic ending for[N]
one of his stature.[AN]
[OpenRight][SendToBack]
A year ago I myself never imagined[N]
I would be leading an army.[AN]
Fate can be unpredictable...[AN]
Perhaps we'll even be able to[N]
turn the tides against Bern.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleMouthMove]...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Lord Roy, what is that[N]
in your hand?[AN]
[OpenRight]Oh, this?[N]
It's the Fire Emblem.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That tiny gemstone...?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Princess Guinivere wanted me[N]
to keep it.[AN]
It seemed...difficult for her[N]
to give it to me...[AN]
I think she still hoped to end[N]
the war with diplomacy...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,[N]
even if that seems unlikely.[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why do you say that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Because Zephiel is the[N]
treacherous king of Bern![AN]
It is said that he murdered[N]
his own father.[AN]
I don't expect he would be[N]
moved by family trust...[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]
He killed his own father?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?[AN]
Zephiel took the throne because[N]
his father, King Desmond, passed on.[AN]
But King Desmond's death was[N]
very sudden.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]So there are rumors...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinivere[N]
know about this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure she is at least[N]
aware of the rumors.[AN]
She may even know the[N]
whole story.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]
