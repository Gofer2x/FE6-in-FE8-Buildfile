## Ch18A_Start1
[OpenMidRight][LoadMartel][OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Father Martel![AN]
We have brought the hermit[N]
Niime as you asked.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.[N]
Let her pass.[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][FastPrint]What do you want from me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You must be Niime,[N]
the Mountain Hermit.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm not aware of that nickname,[N]
but I am Niime.[AN]
I'm probably the one you seek.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We found an elder spell tome[N]
within the castle.[AN]
I hear that you may be capable[N]
of using it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[AN]
I have dedicated my life to the study of[N]
darkness and elder magic.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand that this spell can change[N]
the weather surrounding the caster...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
Stranger spells are known to exist.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Then I order you to use the[N]
tome to create rainfall.[AN]
Make it rain so that the[N]
rivers overflow.[AN]
Push back the advancing[N]
Etrurian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can try, but frankly I can't guarantee[N]
that it will succeed.[AN]
It is also important to remember that powerful[N]
spells like this can only be cast once.[AN]
Are you certain you want to do this?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
No excuses, hag![N]
You will do as I say.[AN]
You said you wish to join our[N]
forces. Make yourself useful.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

## Ch18A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere...[AN]
We are approaching[N]
Bern's army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, I know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
As we get closer, we will clash with[N]
soldiers of Bern more and more.[AN]
It will not be long before we[N]
are in full combat with Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to ask you something[N]
before that happens.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Go ahead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I have heard rumors about[N]
King Zephiel...[AN]
I heard that he killed his father,[N]
the previous king.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
I could scarcely believe it[N]
myself.[AN]
You believe in him so strongly that[N]
you cast away your own country.[AN]
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as[N]
the rumors say,[AN]
I'm sure you would not have done[N]
all that you have.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinivere,[AN]
I accepted the Fire Emblem[N]
not to use it in battle,[AN]
but to find a way to end[N]
this war peacefully.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I think I have a right to know[N]
the truth about the rumors...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]I...I'm sorry.[N]
Please...give me some time.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]...What is the matter?[AN]
Princess Guinivere looked[N]
very troubled...[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...It's nothing to worry over.[N]
Do you need something?[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I have learned some troubling[N]
information.[AN]
A powerful dark mage by the name[N]
of Niime fights in the enemy ranks.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]A dark mage...[N]
A druid, probably.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
In any case, she is apparently[N]
extremely learned in ancient sorcery.[AN]
She is said to be more knowledgable[N]
than most scholars can even imagine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]We can't pull back now.[N]
We press on.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, but please[N]
exercise caution.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.[N]
We must tread lightly![AN][X]

## Ch18A_RiverFreezes1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadMartel]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is the spell ready,[N]
Niime?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
...I'll warn you one more time.[AN]
I can't guarantee the results will[N]
be what you want...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Enough of your yammering![N]
Cast the spell![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sigh... Very well...[AN][X]

## Ch18A_RiverFreezes2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]W-what's going on...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]An enemy spell caster?[N]
Watch out, soldiers![AN][X]

## Ch18A_RiverFreezes3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadMartel][ToggleSmile]What...?![N]
What is this?![AN]
The rivers...[N]
They've frozen over![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, I'll be...[N]
That's not what I expected.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]You![N]
You did this on purpose![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Don't be absurd...[AN]
I gave you ample warning that[N]
I couldn't guarantee any results.[AN]
[OpenRight]Enough! You there![N]
Toss her in the dungeon![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][NormalPrint]Yes, sir![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][SendToBack]Sigh...[AN][X]

## Ch18A_RiverFreezes4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What...happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy, we have a report.[N]
The rivers have apparently frozen over.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ice is so thick that even knights[N]
on horseback can cross them safely.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh...[AN]
Well, good. We can advance[N]
more quickly now.[AN]
Charge the castle gate![AN][X]

## Ch18A_GoddessIconVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager54]
I was told that this goddess icon[N]
would bring me good luck...[AN]
But I pray to it everyday,[N]
and nothing happens.[AN]
That con man tricked me![N]
Here, take it.[AN]
Just looking at it[N]
is making me angry.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_GuidingRingVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager60]
I was playing outside and[N]
this ring fell from the sky![AN][Clear]
...A gift from the gods?[AN]
Nah, someone on a pegasus[N]
or wyvern probably dropped it.[AN]
Here, take it.[N]
I prefer my dolls anyway.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_SecretBookVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager56]
Are you the Etrurian Army?[AN]
Sigh... Bern's army marched through[N]
here just the other day, too.[AN]
When will we have peace again?[AN]
Here, take this.[N]
Use it to end the war.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_MartelSecretWeaponHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager51]
That Martel who's guarding the castle...[AN]
He said he has some secret weapon.[N]
I'd be careful if I were you.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_FrozenRiversHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager52]
When it gets colder the rivers[N]
all freeze over,[AN]
and we can get to the village in[N]
the east without much trouble.[AN]
But it's not quite the[N]
season, unfortunately.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_SwordSaintHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49]
You look strong.[AN]
But I bet you couldn't[N]
beat the Sword Saint.[AN]
They say he's on a[N]
level all his own.[AN][X]

## Ch18A_OldLadyAkaNiimeHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager58]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, are you the Etrurian Army[N]
that the old lady was talking about?[AN]
I heard she was originally[N]
planning to join you guys,[AN]
but for some reason she[N]
joined up with Bern instead.[AN]
What is she thinking?[AN][X]

## Ch18A_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]At last, I am released[N]
from Bern's dungeon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Niime.[AN]
I live in the mountains where[N]
I study arcane magic.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Why were you in the dungeon?[AN]
Did you not join Bern of[N]
your own choice?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, actually, I did,[N]
but it was only a guise.[AN]
Bern's army has something[N]
I wish to study.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And what is that?[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]!![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that sure got your[N]
attention, didn't it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The dragons you speak of...[AN]
They're not like the wyverns[N]
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.[AN]
They're strange troops that fight[N]
alongside Bern's soldiers...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know that well.[AN]
They're the same dragons that[N]
were defeated in the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you know this...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]At first I thought this was only[N]
a simple act of aggression by Bern.[AN]
But then I began to sense a strange[N]
and...evil force among their troops.[AN]
I decided to investigate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Did you learn anything?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons are very much shrouded[N]
in mystery.[AN]
I looked through many ancient books[N]
and scrolls.[AN]
I could only decipher so many of them.[N]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to the conclusion that Bern[N]
has resurrected the demon dragon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The demon dragon...[AN]
The leader of the dragons[N]
that Hartmut defeated.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The very same.[AN]
Dragons are a much more advanced[N]
species than us humans.[AN]
Their vitality and intellect[N]
puts that of humans to shame.[AN]
There is one thing, however, the[N]
dragons lack in.[AN]
They multiply at a fraction of[N]
the rate humans do.[AN]
But the demon dragon...[AN]
It had the power to create[N]
more dragons.[AN]
That is what I learned from[N]
my research.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It can make dragons...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The demon dragon can create more[N]
of its kind.[AN]
That would explain where Bern is[N]
getting all of its dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[AN]
I wish to learn more about[N]
the dragons.[AN]
I wield dark magic...[N]
Let me join your army.[AN]
I'm sure I can be of some[N]
assistance.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[AN]
We want to learn about[N]
the dragons as well.[AN]
It will be a perilous journey,[AN]
but if that's acceptable to you,[N]
you're welcome to join us.[AN][X]
