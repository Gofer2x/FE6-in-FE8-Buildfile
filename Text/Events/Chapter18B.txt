The Etrurian Army[N]
marches toward us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]All according to plan.[AN]
Draw them closer. They will rue[N]
the day they crossed our path.[AN]
Have the other clans been[N]
notified?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They have indeed.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[AN]
...The Etrurian Army will be an[N]
easier foe than the Silver Wolf.[AN]
They don't know this land.[N]
They're unfamiliar with our ways.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The clans unite to fight against[N]
foreign invaders.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, such is the law of Sacae.[AN]
None aided us against the Silver Wolf[N]
because it was a clan dispute.[AN]
But this is a foreign invasion.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The help from the other clans will[N]
be valuable in this fight.[AN]
With such a powerful ally as Bern,[N]
however, they are expendable.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly.[AN]
There are some, though, who dislike the idea[N]
of involving Bern in Sacaen matters.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I hear some clans have even joined[N]
the Silver Wolf's guerrilla force.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]He is a stubborn halfwit.[AN]
His clan was defeated. He should[N]
know better than to oppose us.[AN]
He knows what becomes of those[N]
who try to fight against Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bern has subdued even powerful[N]
cities like Bulgar with ease.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, and if they cannot be beaten,[N]
we have no choice but to join them.[AN]
This is our only path, and the[N]
law of Sacae is unbreakable.[AN][X]

## Ch18B_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere...[AN]
We are approaching[N]
Bern's army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, I know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
As we get closer, we will clash with[N]
soldiers of Bern more and more.[AN]
It will not be long before we[N]
are in full combat with Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to ask you something[N]
before that happens.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Go ahead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I have heard rumors about[N]
King Zephiel...[AN]
I heard that he killed his father,[N]
the previous king.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
I could scarcely believe it[N]
myself.[AN]
You believe in him so strongly that[N]
you cast away your own country.[AN]
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as[N]
the rumors say,[AN]
I'm sure you would not have done[N]
all that you have.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinivere,[AN]
I accepted the Fire Emblem[N]
not to use it in battle,[AN]
but to find a way to end[N]
this war peacefully.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I think I have a right to know[N]
the truth about the rumors...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]I...I'm sorry.[N]
Please...give me some time.[AN][ClearFace][X]

## Ch18B_UniteHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager31]
The clans shall unite[N]
to repel invaders...[AN]
Such is the law[N]
of Sacae.[AN][X]

## Ch18B_PrayHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager31]
Pray to the sky[N]
and the earth...[AN]
Such is the law[N]
of Sacae.[AN][X]

## Ch18B_DefendHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager32]
The clans will defend[N]
against all invaders.[AN]
Such is the law[N]
of Sacae.[AN][X]

## Ch18B_UnitedClansHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager32]
Enemies will face the wrath[N]
of the united clans...[AN]
Such is the law[N]
of Sacae.[AN][X]

## Ch18B_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That was no easy feat.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
But now we've hit our[N]
enemy in Sacae hard.[AN]
I'm sure that's not the[N]
last of them, though.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure they will[N]
retaliate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Do you have any idea[N]
where they might be?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Actually, the spy I sent out[N]
earlier should be back by now.[AN]
I will see if he's learned[N]
anything.[AN][ClearFace][.......]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,[N]
Princess Guinivere?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I wish to tell you[N]
about my brother.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...You don't mind?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
I want you to know before[N]
we enter Bern...[AN]
I want you to know the[N]
tragedies that have occurred.[AN]
You asked before if my[N]
brother murdered our father.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]To be frank...[.....]
he did.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
King Zephiel killed his own[N]
father to seize the throne...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![AN]
[OpenMidRight]No?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Our father tried to kill[N]
Zephiel first.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![N]
Then King Zephiel...[AN]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse[N]
he took from our father.[AN]
So he...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[N]
Why did--[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus]...Lord Roy![AN]
We've located the enemy! They're[N]
still planning their attack![AN][Clear]
Hm? ...What is the matter?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]It is nothing...[N]
Perhaps later...[AN][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...Did I appear at[N]
a bad time?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's fine.[N]
Where are they planning?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]In the city of Bulgar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Bulgar...[N]
I've heard of it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's the largest city in Sacae, but[N]
it's under Bern's control now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand. We'll move[N]
as soon as we can.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Why did the old king try[N]
to murder his own son...?[AN][X]
