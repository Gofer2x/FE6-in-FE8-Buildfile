## Ch19A_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGenericPegasusKnight][OpenMidRight][LoadSigune]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![AN]
The enemy has arrived.[AN]
They are just beyond[N]
the mountains.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It begins.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain,[N]
are you sure?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]About what?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
The Etrurian Army says they[N]
will liberate us from Bern.[AN]
They say they'll give us[N]
our independence...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You can't be fool enough[N]
to believe that.[AN]
No one fights a war[N]
without gain.[AN]
Once they defeat Bern,[N]
they intend to take over.[AN]
It will be the same.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Bern are the better allies. They are[N]
more experienced in warfare.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]
Come now, we have more[N]
immediate problems.[AN]
We must eliminate the enemy[N]
that lies before us.[AN]
Are the ballistae ready?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, the archers are all[N]
at their stations.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good![N]
Fire at them from a distance.[AN]
They'll be floundering around in[N]
the dark of this powerful blizzard.[AN]
Observe nature's wrath...[AN][X]

## Ch19A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Such powerful wind and hail...[N]
I can barely see in front of me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ilia's winters are always like this.[AN]
If you want to fight in this weather,[N]
you'll have to put up with it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We can't allow Bern time to regroup.[N]
We must attack now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're right.[AN]
If the demon dragon is victorious,[N]
it could be the end of us all.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've been wondering...[AN]
Do you think the demon dragon[N]
is in human form as well?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It seems probable.[AN]
It could be that all dragons in[N]
this realm are in human form.[AN]
I've even heard stories of dragons[N]
in human form living with people.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Arcadia...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[N]
What did you say?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er, nothing.[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenMidLeft]I've read that dragons only began to take[N]
human form after the Ending Winter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I expect you've heard of it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but only in legend.[AN]
I learned that in the Ending Winter,[N]
the laws of nature were all warped.[AN]
Day became night, and summer[N]
became winter.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[AN]
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn[N]
that I couldn't decipher all of them.[AN]
But one thing is clear.[AN]
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful[N]
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Nobody knows for certain...[AN]
Legend says the dragons caused it by[N]
releasing vast amounts of magical power,[AN]
but even this theory lacks evidence.[AN]
In any case, it is certain that dragons began[N]
to take human form after the Ending Winter.[AN]
I don't believe these two occurrences[N]
are coincidence.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ultimately,[N]
the truth lies in Bern.[AN][X]

## Ch19A_ReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGenericPegasusKnight][OpenMidRight][LoadSigune]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![AN]
Other pegasus knight squads[N]
are on their way to assist us![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[N]
They will help immensely.[AN]
I almost feel bad for the enemy...[AN]
They'll be in a panic when they're[N]
suddenly attacked from all directions.[AN]
They won't see them coming in[N]
this snowstorm...[AN][X]

## Ch19A_AircaliburVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager54]
You would come to such an[N]
isolated place as this...?[AN]
The prophecies were[N]
correct...[AN]
When the world is covered[N]
in darkness...[AN]
A single blade of wind will[N]
slice through the darkness,[AN]
allowing the light to[N]
shine again.[AN][X]

## Ch19A_EnergyRingVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager50]
I've pondered a lot about whether[N]
I should give in to Bern...[AN]
But I've made up my mind.[N]
I'll hold strong.[AN]
Take this ring. It brings out[N]
your inner strength.[AN]
...Please bring peace[N]
back to this land.[AN][X]

## Ch19A_IvoryDevilHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager53]
You go up against Ivory Devil[N]
Sigune. I wish you luck.[AN]
The Ilian pegasus knights[N]
can fly through the blizzard.[AN]
You'll be blinded by the white...[AN]
and then they will suddenly appear[N]
out of the swirling snow.[AN]
But when that happens it's too[N]
late... You're already dead...[AN][X]

## Ch19A_PegasiBallistaeSiguneHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager57]
[ToggleSmile]Pegasus knights and ballistae...[N]
Captain Sigune is after you.[AN]
She's hiding in the blizzard,[N]
waiting to strike...[AN][X]

## Ch19A_BallistaRangeHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager51]
You know about the ballista[N]
to the east, right?[AN]
We're out of its range here,[N]
but the shop over there isn't...[AN][X]

## Ch19A_EdessaHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49]
Bern's headquarters in Ilia?[AN]
Um, I think it was Edarza...[N]
Edetta... Edessa! That's it.[AN]
It's to the northeast.[AN][X]

## Ch19A_End
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, I need you to send this[N]
letter to Father Yoder in Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]A letter?[N]
May I ask what it says?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It has the information I learned[N]
from Niime about the dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[AN]
What did you learn?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It would take too long to tell you.[AN]
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so[N]
you can look through it if you like.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Very well.[N]
I think I will...[AN][ClearFace][.......]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,[N]
Princess Guinivere?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I wish to tell you[N]
about my brother.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...You don't mind?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
I want you to know before[N]
we enter Bern...[AN]
I want you to know the[N]
tragedies that have occurred.[AN]
You asked before if my[N]
brother murdered our father.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]To be frank...[.....]
he did.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
King Zephiel killed his own[N]
father to seize the throne...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![AN]
[OpenMidRight]No?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Our father tried to kill[N]
Zephiel first.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![N]
Then King Zephiel...[AN]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse[N]
he took from our father.[AN]
So he...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[N]
Why did--[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]
The dragons are mysterious[N]
creatures indeed... Hm?[AN]
What is the matter?[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]It is nothing...[N]
Perhaps later...[AN][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Did I appear at[N]
a bad time?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's fine.[N]
Did you send the letter?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Yes, I sent it off after[N]
reading through it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Why did the old king try[N]
to murder his own son...?[AN][X]
