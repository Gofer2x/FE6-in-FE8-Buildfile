## Ch19B_Start1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoartz][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
They're here...![N]
And so soon...[AN]
If only we had more time[N]
to prepare our defenses![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKel]
We will try to stop the enemy[N]
from progressing any further.[AN]
Please retreat to the mansion[N]
and fortify your defenses there.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you think you can[N]
succeed in stopping them?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot say,[N]
but we will try.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
If you aren't confident you'll[N]
be victorious, then I'll--[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You'll what? Flee?[AN]
Tell me, just where do[N]
you think you can hide?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
General Brunnya has ordered[N]
me to protect you.[AN]
And so I shall, to the[N]
very limits of my ability.[AN]
But there may come a time when[N]
you must take up arms as well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...V-very well...[AN]
Then I shall fortify the inside.[N]
I leave the outside to you.[AN][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
...That coward is the high[N]
chancellor of Etruria?[AN]
Why does he deserve our[N]
protection?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's not as if General Brunnya[N]
cares for the man.[AN]
She is obligated to protect him[N]
because he turned to our side.[AN]
Wretched though he may be, we[N]
have a duty to fulfill.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
By the way, I understand the Silver[N]
Wolf has been lurking around here.[AN]
Keep on guard at all times and be[N]
ready for anything.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...We fight again today.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must.[AN]
I am sorry I've had no time[N]
to speak with you at length.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not your fault.[AN]
...If the blame lies with[N]
anyone, it is my brother.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]May I ask why your father tried[N]
to murder King Zephiel?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.[N]
In actuality, I am his half sister.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother[N]
was an Etrurian noblewoman.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's correct.[AN]
They were arranged to be wed for[N]
political reasons.[AN]
However, our father was already[N]
in love with another woman.[AN]
That was my mother.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
The marriage between the king and[N]
Zephiel's mother was forced.[AN]
Our father didn't love Zephiel's[N]
mother and always resented their son.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Was that the cause of all[N]
the troubles that happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
I remember Zephiel working hard,[N]
vying for our father's affection.[AN]
He was a brilliant scholar and a[N]
prodigy in combat.[AN]
He grew to become a fine heir[N]
to Bern's throne.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the[N]
king try to--[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Lord Roy![N]
We are ready for the attack![AN]
[OpenRight]Understood.[N]
I only need a moment![AN][Clear]
Princess Guinivere,[N]
I am sorry, but I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I understand. Go.[N]
Please be careful.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_NiimeItBegins
[OpenRight][LoadNiime][ToggleSmile]
Well, well...[N]
It begins.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadDayan]So it seems.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager31]
Bern's invasion finally ends, and now[N]
here comes Etruria. Will it never end?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]Small wonder.[N]
This is a large trading city.[AN]
Any army would want control of it.[AN]
If you'll excuse me...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]H-hey, wait,[N]
where are you going?[AN]
[OpenRight]I'm going to observe the fight.[N]
Let us see how good this Roy is.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean now?[N]
But...[AN]
[OpenRight]Don't you worry about me.[N]
I'll be fine.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]What? Stop![N]
Don't leave me alone![AN][X]

## Ch19B_ReinforcementsComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKel]The reinforcements should be[N]
arriving soon...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidLeft]
Open the front gate to let the[N]
reinforcements in when they arrive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_HouseEnemiesComing
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKel][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft]Have the guerrilla forces hiding in[N]
the houses commence their attack.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_OpenTheGate
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]They'll be here any moment now...[N]
Open the gate![AN][X]

## Ch19B_WyrmslayerVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager31]
I was selling weapons to Bern[N]
before the war...[AN]
But now that they've taken[N]
over the city, they won't pay![AN]
Here, take this wyrmslayer.[N]
Just do something about them.[AN][Clear]
I've been hiding it from them...[N]
I think you can guess why...[AN][X]

## Ch19B_EnergyRingVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager29]
Would you like a special ring[N]
from Etruria?[AN]
I used to sell them, but I had to[N]
close my shop because of the war.[AN]
Here, take it. No charge...[N]
No one will buy it anyway.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_GoddessIconVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager33]
This goddess icon[N]
brings good luck.[AN]
...I used to con people[N]
by saying that.[AN]
I can't do business[N]
with this war, though.[AN]
Here, take one.[AN]
It won't really bring[N]
you any luck, though.[AN][X]

## Ch19B_WoDaoVillage
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager35]
Wow... Lucky me![N]
Finders keepers.[AN]
I bet I can sell[N]
this thing...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa![N]
A-are you from Bern?[AN]
No, I didn't steal[N]
this![AN]
See ya![AN][X]

## Ch19B_LongbowVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager34]
This is a longbow, a favorite[N]
of the Sacaen nomads.[AN]
Here, take one.[AN]
Use it to drive Bern's[N]
soldiers out of here![AN][X]

## Ch19B_End
[OpenLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenLeft]I must say, you're not[N]
half bad at all.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-who are you!?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]I told you to stop![AN]
You may not enter.[N]
Lord Roy is not accepting visitors.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What's going on?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
She was very insistent about[N]
seeing you.[AN]
But you have more important[N]
matters to attend to.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Just hear me out first.[AN]
I think I have some information[N]
you might want to hear.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...And what would that be?[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
It is about the dragons[N]
who are in human form.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][......][ToggleSmile]...I wish to speak[N]
with her in private.[AN]
Will you leave us, please?[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Yes, milord.[AN][ClearFace]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Well, that sure got your[N]
attention, didn't it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The dragons you speak of...[AN]
They're not like the wyverns[N]
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.[AN]
They're strange troops that fight[N]
alongside Bern's soldiers...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I know that well.[AN]
They're the same dragons that[N]
were defeated in the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Who are you, exactly?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Niime.[AN]
I live in the mountains where I study[N]
arcane magic.[AN]
Some call me Niime the Hermit.[AN][Clear]
At first I thought this was only[N]
a simple act of aggression by Bern.[AN]
But then I began to sense a strange[N]
and...evil force among their troops.[AN]
I decided to investigate.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Did you learn anything?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons are very much shrouded[N]
in mystery.[AN]
I looked through many ancient books[N]
and scrolls.[AN]
I could only decipher so many of them.[N]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to the conclusion that Bern[N]
has resurrected the demon dragon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The demon dragon...[AN]
The leader of the dragons[N]
that Hartmut defeated.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The very same.[AN]
Dragons are a much more advanced[N]
species than us humans.[AN]
Their vitality and intellect[N]
puts that of humans to shame.[AN]
There is one thing, however, the[N]
dragons lack in.[AN]
They multiply at a fraction of[N]
the rate humans do.[AN]
But the demon dragon...[AN]
It had the power to create[N]
more dragons.[AN]
That is what I learned from[N]
my research.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It can make dragons...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The demon dragon can create more[N]
of its kind.[AN]
That would explain where Bern is[N]
getting all of its dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That seems likely.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[AN]
I wish to learn more about[N]
the dragons.[AN]
I wield dark magic...[N]
Let me join your army.[AN]
I'm sure I can be of some[N]
assistance.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[AN]
We want to learn about[N]
the dragons as well.[AN]
It will be a perilous journey,[AN]
but if that's acceptable to you,[N]
you're welcome to join us.[AN][X]
