Well?[N]
How does it look?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
Actually, milord...we've requested aid[N]
from Ilia's knights,[AN]
but all but those directly under[N]
Sir Murdock seem reluctant to help.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Curses! Things couldn't[N]
possibly get any worse...[AN][Clear]
Ah, but we did capture[N]
Zelot's wife.[AN]
What is the word on Zelot's[N]
troop? Have they responded?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, milord...[AN]
They are traveling mercenary knights,[N]
so we do not know their location.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Blast it...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Ever since Sigune's defeat,[AN]
Ilia's militia has been hesitant[N]
to attack the Etrurian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Cowards! Every last one of them![AN]
The great High Chancellor Roartz will[N]
not die in this miserable wasteland![AN][X]

## Ch20A_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager56][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Cough...cough...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJuno][CloseSpeechFast]Are you all right?[N]
Here, take my shawl.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I couldn't.[N]
You'll freeze...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I can handle it.[N]
I'm used to these temperatures.[AN]
This is nothing compared to[N]
flying through a blizzard.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...Thank you.[N]
Cough...cough...[AN][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager53][ToggleSmile]Lady Juno...[N]
What's going to happen?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...I don't know.[N]
But we must stay hopeful.[AN]
The enemy may retreat, or[N]
perhaps Zelot might return.[AN]
This isn't the end.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Where is Sir Zelot now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
His last letter said he planned to join[N]
the Lycian Army, but after that...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Well, he may be closer than[N]
we realize.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I hope you're right.[AN][X]

## Ch20A_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We fight again today.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must.[AN]
Once we take this castle,[AN]
it will be our new base[N]
before we enter Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[AN]
May I ask why your father tried[N]
to murder King Zephiel?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.[N]
In actuality, I am his half sister.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother[N]
was an Etrurian noblewoman.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's correct.[AN]
They were arranged to be wed for[N]
political reasons.[AN]
However, our father was already[N]
in love with another woman.[AN]
That was my mother.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
The marriage between the king and[N]
Zephiel's mother was forced.[AN]
Our father didn't love Zephiel's[N]
mother and always resented their son.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Was that the cause of all[N]
the troubles that happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]
I remember Zephiel working hard,[N]
vying for our father's affection.[AN]
He was a brilliant scholar and a[N]
prodigy in combat.[AN]
He grew to become a fine heir[N]
to Bern's throne.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the[N]
king try to--[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Lord Roy![N]
We are ready for the attack![AN]
[OpenRight]Understood.[N]
I only need a moment![AN]
[Clear]Princess Guinivere,[N]
I am sorry, but I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I understand. Go.[N]
Please be careful.[AN][X]

## Ch20A_CathAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]Brrrr![AN]
I knew Ilia was cold, but I[N]
didn't think it was THIS cold![AN]
And there's just snow[N]
everywhere you look![AN]
[ToggleSmile]The pure white...[N]
It's beautiful in a way...[AN]
Whoops, no time to admire[N]
the scenery.[AN]
I'm here for the moolah...[AN][X]

## Ch20A_GaidenGone
[OpenLeft][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The blizzard is picking up...[AN]
This might take longer than[N]
we expected.[AN]
We should head for Bern as soon[N]
as we take the castle.[AN][X]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Sister! Juno![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Shanna? What are[N]
you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm with the Etrurian Army.[AN]
I was surprised when I heard[N]
Edessa was taken by Bern,[AN]
but I knew you'd be OK.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Oh? Why do you say that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were a captain of the[N]
pegasus knights![AN]
There's no way Bern could[N]
defeat you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, you'll be sorry to hear[N]
that I was captured.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]That's...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
But I don't intend to surrender[N]
to Bern.[AN]
All I could do on my own was try to[N]
keep the people in the castle safe,[AN]
but if I join you, I actually stand[N]
a fighting chance against Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then are you going to[N]
fight with us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Of course.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Really? Hurray![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What's so exciting[N]
about that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I became a pegasus knight because[N]
I wanted to be just like you.[AN]
Fighting alongside you is like[N]
a dream come true.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? I'm honored...[AN]
You always have tended to[N]
go overboard with things...[AN][X]

What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a long story...[N]
But I'm with the Etrurian Army now.[AN]
I'd heard that Edessa had fallen[N]
to Bern so I was worried, but...[AN]
I'm glad to see that you're[N]
all right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'd heard that you were[N]
fighting against this army.[AN][Clear]
You didn't betray...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No! Never![AN]
I never betrayed the code.[AN]
I did everything I was[N]
supposed to.[AN]
I just eventually ended[N]
up in the Etrurian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course...[AN]
You're a good and diligent soldier.[N]
I should have known better.[AN]
I'm sorry.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's all right...[AN]
But, um...[N]
What are you wearing?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[AN]
Why, this is my combat uniform.[N]
Don't you remember it?[AN]
What do you think?[AN]
Think I can still make a[N]
decent captain?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, but I[N]
thought you retired.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]With such dire stakes I had no[N]
choice but to come out of retirement.[AN]
On my own all I could do was[N]
defend the people in the castle,[AN]
but if I join you, I can actually[N]
strike back against Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then you're going to[N]
fight alongside us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's what[N]
I'm getting at.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That makes me so happy![AN]
I never thought I'd be able to[N]
fight alongside you again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't get ahead of yourself.[AN]
You still have a long way[N]
to catch up to me![AN][X]

I used to be a captain, you know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know,[N]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[N]
They didn't do anything to me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Why are you in the[N]
Etrurian Army?[AN]
I thought you were[N]
with Lycia.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it's a long story...[AN]
What it comes down to is that this[N]
is the Etrurian Army only in name.[AN]
It's actually made up primarily of[N]
soldiers from the Lycian Army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Oh... Interesting.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry I wasn't here[N]
when you needed me most...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no use for[N]
regret at this point.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But you were forced[N]
to fight...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh? I thought you liked[N]
my combat uniform.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I do![N]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[AN]
You'll be seeing a lot[N]
more of it from now on...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What?![N]
Do you mean...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I do.[AN]
I will fight[N]
alongside you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No! I can't accept that.[N]
You retired years ago.[AN]
Leave the fighting[N]
to us...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I may have retired, but I still had to[N]
take up arms to defend the castle.[AN]
Zelot, this world isn't safe anymore.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I will fight.[AN]
I want to bring peace back[N]
