[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadTick][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Tick![N]
The enemy is advancing![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't panic.[AN]
The path through the[N]
ruins is blocked off.[AN]
They're not getting[N]
in here so easily.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But the enemy has had so many[N]
victories against Ilia's troops![AN]
Even many of our own men have[N]
fallen to them.[AN]
I don't see how we can expect[N]
victory...![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We don't need a victory.[AN]
General Murdock said that we[N]
simply must hold our ground.[AN]
We defend until the enemy[N]

about this place?[AN]

He was honorable in[N]
everything he did.[AN]
...This building seems to[N]
have walls everywhere.[AN]
Is there a way inside?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bern's forces most likely blocked the[N]
pathways to cover their tracks.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then they must have been[N]
in a rush...[AN]
Maybe the walls are weak in[N]
certain areas.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That is quite possible.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]All right.[N]
Let's do what we can.[AN][X]

it were made of ice.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy,[N]
Bern's troops are fleeing.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[N]
Let them go.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Let them go?[N]
We must attack.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, don't.[N]
We've already won.[AN]
They don't want to[N]
fight us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They all have lives[N]
and families.[AN]
There's no need to take[N]
that away from them.[AN][X]
