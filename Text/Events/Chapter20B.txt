[OpenMidRight][LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]
The worthless fools outside failed![N]
The enemy is in the mansion![AN]
[MoveMidRight]Blast it![AN]
If I die I'm taking[N]
that Roy down with me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]Lord Roartz![AN]
The remnants of the Djute say they'll come[N]
to our aid after they hide Mulagir.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Mulagir?[.....]
Ah, one of the legendary weapons.[AN]
Good. Then we must[N]
simply hold out until then![AN][X]

## Ch20B_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is Roartz's manor...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
This mansion's framework is big enough[N]
to hide troops and ballistae.[AN]
You won't be safe with your back up[N]
against the wall.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know much[N]
about this place?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Probably more than most, anyway.[N]
That's what I'm known for.[AN]
I picked up that bit of[N]
information back in the city.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you know what the[N]
demon dragon looks like?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't say that I do.[AN]
Still, I would relish the opportunity[N]
to see it with my own eyes.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I've been wondering...[AN]
Do you think the demon dragon[N]
is in human form as well?[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenMidLeft]It seems probable.[AN]
It could be that all dragons in[N]
this realm are in human form.[AN]
I've even heard stories of dragons[N]
in human form living with people.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Arcadia...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[N]
What did you say?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Er, nothing.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I've read that dragons only began to take[N]
human form after the Ending Winter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I expect you've heard of it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but only in legend.[AN]
I learned that in the Ending Winter,[N]
the laws of nature were all warped.[AN]
Day became night, and summer[N]
became winter.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[AN]
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn[N]
that I couldn't decipher all of them.[AN]
But one thing is clear.[AN]
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful[N]
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Nobody knows for certain...[AN]
Legend says the dragons caused it by[N]
releasing vast amounts of magical power,[AN]
but even this theory lacks evidence.[AN]
In any case, it is certain that dragons began[N]
to take human form after the Ending Winter.[AN]
I don't believe these two occurrences[N]
are coincidence.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ultimately,[N]
the truth lies in Bern.[AN][X]

## Ch20B_GaidenGone
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSacaeGaidenBosses]Pigs from Etruria...![AN]
I will avenge the Djute[N]
right here, right now![AN]

## Ch20B_DayanAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan]
The manor is in chaos.[N]
Now is my chance.[AN]
I will take down Bern's[N]
troops on my own![AN][X]

## Ch20B_CathAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]
Soooo...[AN]
Bulgar, huh? The biggest[N]
city in Sacae.[AN]
I heard it was sacked by Bern.[N]
Look at all the soldiers...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sure there are plenty of[N]
goodies just waiting to be swiped.[AN][X]

## Ch20B_RoyRecruitsDayan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you the general of[N]
the Etrurian Army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I am. And you are?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Dayan.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Dayan...?[N]
I feel I've heard the name...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]First, allow me to thank you.[AN]
My clan has been fighting against[N]
Bern and their followers.[AN]
We haven't a chance against them[N]
head on,[AN]
so we've resorted to guerrilla[N]
tactics.[AN]
Since your arrival, however, the[N]
odds are tipping in our favor.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I am glad that I could help.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That said, I wish to ask[N]
you one thing.[AN]
Once this battle is over,[N]
I request that you withdraw.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]After this battle?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacae belongs to the Sacaens.[AN]
If Bern's iron-fisted rule is only[N]
to be replaced by Etruria's,[AN]
then you will leave us no choice[N]
but to fight against you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry... I cannot comply with[N]
that request.[AN]
We must base ourselves in Sacae to[N]
launch our direct attack on Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You...plan to attack Bern directly?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if we push Bern back now, it's only[N]
a matter of time until they strike back.[AN]
We must bring the fight to their heartland[N]
to stop this war. Do you not agree?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I do.[AN]
I see...[AN]
In that case, I[N]
shall join you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That would help tremendously.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But once Bern is defeated, you must[N]
withdraw your troops from Sacae.[AN]
Do I have your word?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[N]
I swear it.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue?![N]
You are unharmed?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks to this army, yes.[AN]
But I was the only one of[N]
our clansmen to survive...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... You've been[N]
through much.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Grandfather, come with us.[N]
This army will not invade Sacae.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Are you certain?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]As certain as the Sky is blue[N]
and the Earth is green.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.[N]
I trust your word.[AN][X]

## Ch20B_SinRecruitsDayan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]Chieftain![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sin, you've returned![N]
Now you can join our fight...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Chieftain...[AN]
I am currently in service[N]
to this army.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you mean the[N]
Etrurian Army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
This army will not invade Sacae.[N]
Will you lend us your skills?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.[N]
I trust your word.[AN]
I will fight with you.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue?![N]
You are unharmed?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks to this army, yes.[AN]
But I was the only one of our[N]
clansmen to survive...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... You've been[N]
through much.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Grandfather, do you[N]
fight with us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have joined this group.[AN]
I don't believe that this army[N]
will try to take Sacae from us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I agree...[AN][X]

## Ch20B_SinDayanTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]Chieftain![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sin, you've returned![N]
We fight together again...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chieftain...[AN]
Have you joined[N]
this army?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I have indeed.[AN]
I don't believe they intend[N]
to take Sacae from us.[AN]
What do you think of them?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[N]
They mean well.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[N]
Then we fight together.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Chieftain.[AN][X]

## Ch20B_EndGaidenGot
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Next is Bern...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy![AN]
We have reports that remnants of the[N]
Djute are hiding in some nearby ruins.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Ruins?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and a captive tells us there's a bow[N]
there that was used in the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[N]
Then...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's likely that it's[N]
a legendary weapon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We must get to those ruins![N]
Let's go![AN][X]
