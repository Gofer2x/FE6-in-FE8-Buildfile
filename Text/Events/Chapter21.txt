General Murdock. All troops are[N]
at their posts and ready for battle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Thank you.[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][Clear][OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle]
[OpenMidRight]Galle.[N]
It will begin soon.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My men are ready.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Your squad will be the key to[N]
victory in this battle.[AN]
Do you understand?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Of course, Sir Murdock.[N]
I won't disappoint you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I expect not.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]The enemy are but insects next[N]
to the might of Bern's army.[AN]
Even so...that Lycian general[N]
has made it far.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]General Roy?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. Roy.[AN]
I hope to be able to duel him in[N]
a fair fight, one on one.[AN][X]

## Ch21_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ah, General Roy![N]
I have found you at last.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Father Yoder![AN]
What brings you all[N]
the way from Etruria?[AN]
Is something amiss?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

I did some additional research[N]
after reading your letter.[AN]
I reached the same conclusion. Bern[N]
has resurrected the demon dragon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You think so, too?[AN]
...Hartmut defeated the[N]
demon dragon in the Scouring.[AN]
How could Bern have brought[N]
it back to life?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Apparently after defeating it,[N]
Hartmut chose to spare its life.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Instead of killing it, he sealed[N]
it away in the mountains of Bern.[AN]
The sword he used to seal it was...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Binding Blade?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, you know of it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I learned a little bit[N]
of it in my studies...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
The demon dragon's seal may have been[N]
broken, but with the Binding Blade,[AN]
we may be able to seal it away once[N]
more or kill it for good.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you know where the[N]
demon dragon might be?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I believe so.[AN]
We know dragons change into[N]
human form,[AN]
and the demon dragon is most[N]
likely in such a form as well.[AN]
I have a suspect already.[AN]
The "Dark Priestess" that is[N]
always at King Zephiel's side.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Dark Priestess...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
There is no solid evidence that[N]
she is the demon dragon,[AN]
but she appeared shortly before[N]
the other dragons did.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]
The dragons seal away their power[N]
in gems called dragonstones.[AN]
Remaining in their dragon form[N]
uses too much energy otherwise.[AN]
The same is likely true for[N]
the demon dragon as well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We must see her in person[N]
and find the truth.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Allow me to go with you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
You will fight alongside us?[N]
By all means![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I have also been instructed[N]
to give you these.[AN]
They are legendary weapons[N]
that the church located.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Legendary weapons?![N]
These will be invaluable![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
If the demon dragon has been released,[AN]
then this is the greatest crisis[N]
mankind has faced since the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We must rise like the Eight Legends[N]
of yore to save humanity once again.[AN][X]

## Ch21_GalleAppears

Knights of Bern![N]
We strike now![AN]
Leave none alive![AN]
Don't even leave them[N]
time to scream in fear![AN][X]

## Ch21_GaidenGone
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeres][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Have you dealt with the[N]
legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir, it has[N]
been disposed of.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[AN]
Now we go to General[N]
Murdock's aid![AN][X]

## Ch21_MeladyGalleTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][ToggleSmile]Galle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Melady...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Galle...[N]
I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not speak...[AN]
You and I are both[N]
loyal knights.[AN]
We both fight in our[N]
masters' names.[AN]
That is all there is[N]
to know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Melady...[AN]
This is probably the end,[N]
so let me say this.[AN]
I am truly grateful I was[N]
fortunate enough to meet you.[AN]
We trained together, and we[N]
fought alongside each other.[AN]
Melady...[N]
The days I spent with you...[AN]
They were the happiest days[N]
of my life.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
M...mine, too...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Good-bye, Melady.[AN]
My only regret is that we didn't[N]
meet in a more peaceful time.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Galle...[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Wait![AN]
Galle![AN]
Don't go![AN]
Gaaalle!![AN][X]

## Ch21_ZeissGalleTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Galle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.[N]
You seem to be well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Galle...[N]
Must we truly fight?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[N]
We must.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I don't want to[N]
fight you![AN]
You're the last[N]
person I ever...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![N]
Are you a child?![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Did you have this little faith in[N]
your choice when you left Bern?[AN]
Do you regret your decision to[N]
fight against Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No! My mind is...set...[AN]
It still hurts to point my blade[N]
towards Bern, my homeland...[AN]
But the path I chose was not[N]
a mistake...![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then cast away your hesitation![AN]
Focus on defeating those who block[N]
the path that you have chosen.[AN][Clear]
...No matter who that may be.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Galle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss...[N]
Are you a knight of Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Of course![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![AN]
Then when next we meet,[N]
there will be no words.[AN]
Our blades will cross, and[N]
one will be left standing![AN][X]

## Ch21_SaulYoderTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Father Yoder.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Saul, it is good to see[N]
you well.[AN]
And thank you.[AN]
You and Dorothy have done a[N]
great service to the church.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...There is no greater pleasure[N]
than to know I have been of use.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh? I've never known you[N]
to be so serious...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Father Yoder, despite all[N]
appearances, I am a priest.[AN]
The common good is my[N]
greatest concern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am sorry I doubted you.[AN]
From this point, we[N]
fight together.[AN][X]

## Ch21_DorothyYoderTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy,[N]
have you been well?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Very much so.[AN]
It is good to see[N]
you, Father Yoder.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are always so cheery and[N]
full of energy.[AN]
I'm sure Saint Elimine[N]
adores that about you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Just being around you cleanses the[N]
heart and makes one feel pure.[AN]
I'm sure that's true even for Saul.[N]
You have much to be proud of.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,[N]
Father Yoder![AN][X]

## Ch21_KnightCrestVillage

You're the Etrurian Army,[N]
aren't you?[AN]
There are no soldiers[N]
here.[AN]
Take this. Just leave[N]
us in peace![AN][X]

## Ch21_EndGaidenGot
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy... There is a path[N]
leading underground here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Is the Binding Blade[N]
down that way?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I cannot say...[AN]
But a captive tells us that there[N]
are two weapons in this shrine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that right?[AN]
Does that mean that there[N]
is another legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Possibly...[AN]
Perhaps we should ask those in[N]
our army who hail from Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]
Yes, I'll see if[N]
they know anything.[AN][X]
