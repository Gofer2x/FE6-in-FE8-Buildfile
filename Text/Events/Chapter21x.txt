## Ch21x_Start
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeres][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight]
The battle was lost...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it appears so.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I wish I could have been at General[N]
Murdock's side when he fell.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I share your feelings.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We carry out our final orders from[N]
General Murdock as planned.[AN]
We will defend the legendary weapon[N]
to our deaths if need be.[AN]
Apocalypse, the Elder Revelation,[N]
must not fall into enemy hands![AN][X]

## Ch21x_Start2Melady
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
There is a legendary weapon[N]
in this place?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I believe so.[AN]
All I've heard are rumors from other[N]
soldiers,[AN]
but there is apparently a tome meant[N]
to protect the shrine from intruders.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]
I agree that the tome is[N]
likely a legendary weapon.[AN]
Bern's troops are present[N]
as well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We will soon fight Zephiel himself.[AN]
...We need as many legendary weapons[N]
as we can obtain before then.[AN]
We must get that tome.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady]
I have also heard that there are[N]
numerous traps placed about.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and they are supposedly[N]
very well-crafted at that.[AN]
Most of us probably lack the[N]
dexterity to disarm them,[AN]
but thieves may be able to[N]
take care of them.[AN]
In any case, do be careful.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must stay[N]
on our guard.[AN][X]

## Ch21x_Start2Zeiss
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]There is a legendary weapon[N]

## Ch21x_Start2Guinivere
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
This is where the legendary weapon[N]
is, Princess Guinivere?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Most likely...[AN]
All I know is that there is a tome here[N]
meant to protect the shrine from intruders.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I agree that the tome is[N]
likely a legendary weapon.[AN]
Bern's troops are present[N]

## Ch21x_End
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin, do you know what[N]
this spell tome is?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is probably Apocalypse.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Apocalypse?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is also known as the[N]
Elder Revelation.[AN]
It was used by Bramimond, the most[N]
enigmatic of the Eight Legends.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Bramimond...[AN]
I've heard the name,[N]
but nothing more.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
We know not if Bramimond was[N]
man or woman, young or old.[AN]
Nothing specific is written.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's unusual...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, is something wrong?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No, I was just thinking.[AN]
[OpenLeft]About what?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]There always seem to be traps[N]
where legendary weapons lie.[AN]
[OpenLeft]...Perhaps they are meant to keep[N]
the unworthy from wielding them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe so...[N]
But the traps are so intricate.[AN]
I feel there must be something[N]
more to them than that.[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]
...I have wondered the same thing.[AN]
I shall see if there is any[N]
information on the subject.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[N]
Thank you.[AN][X]
