[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What you're saying, then...[N]
is that Murdock is dead...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...I am sorry,[N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What is the Etrurian[N]
Army's next move?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They have captured the Shrine of Seals.[N]
They march this way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Very well...[AN]
Then we face them[N]
in the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, my king.[N]
My life is yours.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
No. You cannot die here,[N]
Brunnya.[AN]
I have a task of grave[N]
importance for you.[AN][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Idunn![N]
Where are you, Idunn?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][NormalPrint]...Here, Your Highness.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I will remain here and defend the[N]
castle against the Etrurian Army.[AN]
You must escape to safety and stay[N]
hidden until the battle is over.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]As Your Highness wills.[AN][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Brunnya, you will[N]
guard Idunn.[AN]
Protect her as you[N]
would protect me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
No, Your Majesty![N]
Please![AN]
Allow me to fight[N]
by your side![AN]
[OpenMidRight]That is something I[N]
cannot do.[AN]
...This will be a harsh battle,[N]
and Idunn must survive.[AN]
If she is lost...this entire[N]
struggle has been for nothing.[AN]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I must object, Your Majesty![N]
I serve you and you alone...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Enough, Brunnya![N]
Your king orders you.[AN]
The punishment for[N]
defiance is execution.[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes...Your Majesty...[AN][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Idunn, if I fall...[AN]
The plan continues.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]As you will...[AN]
The world will be liberated[N]
as per Your Highness's command.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Then my dream[N]
will be fulfilled.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Of course, Your Highness.[AN][X]

## Ch22_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian Army...[AN]
I will not let you into[N]
the throne room![AN][X]

## Ch22_Start3
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]I shall protect this[N]
switch with my life![AN][X]

## Ch22_Start4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[ToggleSmile][FastPrint]This is the king's castle...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]
Lord Roy, Zephiel is in the throne[N]
room in the center of the castle.[AN]
However, the entryway to the throne[N]
is blocked off by automatic defenses.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What can be done?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
One of the captives said that[N]
at either end of the castle,[AN]
there are some switches that can[N]
be manipulated to open the way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That will be a long detour...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.[AN]
After hitting the switches,[AN]
one must hold the Fire Emblem in front[N]
of the throne room to make it open.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I have the Fire Emblem with me.[AN][Clear]
It sounds like I should go to the throne[N]
room while others handle the switches...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be the quickest way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...But would a captive leak that[N]
kind of information so easily?[AN]
Perhaps it's a trap...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't believe so.[AN]
The captive said the switches are[N]
protected by Bern's ablest warriors.[AN]
Even with this information, it will[N]
be no easy feat.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The enemy may be powerful, but we're[N]
not exactly slouches, either.[AN]
I know we're up for the challenge![N]
Victory will be ours![AN][X]

## Ch22_CathAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
Castle Bern... A worthy target[N]
for the Master Thief.[AN]
I'm sure there's mountains of[N]
gold hidden in here somewhere![AN][X]

## Ch22_Switch1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[ToggleSmile]Is this the switch?[N]
Nothing's happening...[AN][X]

## Ch22_Switch2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[ToggleSmile]Is this the switch?[N]
Nothing's happening...[AN][X]

## Ch22_ThroneRoomOpen
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZephiel][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've come.[AN]
Hmph... It's laughable, really.[N]
A mere child making it so far.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Zephiel...[N]
King of Bern...[AN]
[MoveRight][OpenRight]
Why did you start this war?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I wish to end the[N]
Age of Man.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]...I don't understand.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Humans...are filthy and despicable[N]
creatures.[AN]
They flock to the promise of power[N]
like hideous, hairless sheep,[AN]
and they stab trusted allies[N]
while their backs are turned.[AN]
I'm certain you have witnessed as much[N]
even from many who claim to serve me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Jealousy. Hatred. Greed.[AN]
Friends and family are driven to murder[N]
one another by these petty emotions.[AN]
Such emotions spawn fathers who would[N]
even kill their own brood.[AN]
As long as humans control,[N]
as long as humans exist,[AN]
this madness will never end.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]
But consider what you've done![AN]
You've become exactly that[N]
which you despise![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you know how[N]
the Scouring ended?[AN]
[OpenRight]The demon dragon was[N]
defeated by Hartmut...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. It was history's greatest mistake.[N]
Mankind should not have won.[AN]
Humans perverted this world into an[N]
ordurous cesspool of madness and evil.[AN]
All through their illogical and[N]
contemptible emotions![AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]
Mistakes cannot be left uncorrected.[AN]
I will liberate the world from the grasp[N]
of man and return it to the dragons.[AN]
The slate will be wiped clean.[N]
History will be rewritten.[AN]
It is the only way to free the[N]
world from everlasting agony![AN]
[OpenRight]Is it true that you[N]
resurrected the demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There is no need to answer that. You[N]
will know for yourself before long.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]You said you intend to give the[N]
world to the dragons.[AN]
How would rule by dragons be[N]
any different?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons you have seen are[N]
weapons for battle.[AN]
They have no self.[AN]
They lack reprehensible emotions[N]
to drive them, unlike humans.[AN]
The dragons' rule will be[N]
just and peaceful.[AN]
[OpenRight]Such a world can't be[N]
a better alternative![AN]
Some humans may commit[N]
terrible atrocities,[AN]
but it has always been other[N]
humans who have stopped them![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Your naivety amuses me.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]
You have lost faith in humanity[N]
and in yourself.[AN]
I believe in mankind, and I know[N]
that your lunacy must be stopped![AN][X]

## Ch22_EndTrue
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Zephiel has fallen...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]We've done it,[N]
Lord Roy.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]...Or have we?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]What do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Priestess is[N]
nowhere to be found...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]...She must have[N]
escaped.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...So it seems.[AN]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[.....]
What was that?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Zephiel's sword...[N]
it's glowing![AN]
It's...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Eckesachs...[AN]
A sword that only the[N]
king of Bern can use...[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Lord Roy, legend says that when all[N]
the legendary weapons come together,[AN]
the Dragon Sanctuary will rise from[N]
the ground![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The Dragon Sanctuary...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]It was the headquarters[N]
and lair of the dragons...[AN]
That's what the legends[N]
say, anyway.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[N]
I've heard that, too.[AN]
[OpenRight]Does that mean Eckesachs is[N]
the final legendary weapon?[AN]
I thought it was the[N]
Binding Blade.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...The Binding Blade may be on an even[N]
higher level than the legendary weapons...[AN]
It may be its own entity, beyond compare[N]
to even the legendary weapons...[AN]
[OpenRight]More powerful than the legendary weapons...?[N]
What power lies in this sword?[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]The sword is glowing again![AN]
The light is pointing[N]
to the south![AN][SendToBack]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[OpenRight]
Will the light lead us[N]
to the Dragon Sanctuary?[AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]
That is how the[N]
stories go.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]
...If the Dark Priestess is the[N]
demon dragon as we suspect...[AN]
then she is most likely at[N]
the sanctuary...[AN]
[OpenRight]Very well.[N]
We follow the light![AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zephiel...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Princess Guinivere.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...[N]
I need some time alone.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess...![AN]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy...[N]
You should leave her be.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]...An admirable job.[AN]
[OpenRight]Elffin![AN]
[ToggleSmile]...Thank you.[AN]
Your homeland is in turmoil...[N]
yet you chose to help us.[AN]
You've been an asset[N]
to us all...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm afraid I don't know what you[N]
mean by my "homeland"...[AN]
But it was my greatest pleasure to[N]
assist you.[AN]
[OpenRight]I'll never be able[N]
to repay this.[AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][Clear][.....]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Control by humans...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Are you thinking of[N]
Zephiel's final words?[AN]
He may have been right...[N]
in a way.[AN]
[OpenRight]...Has the Dark Priestess[N]
been found?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Unfortunately not...[AN]
She apparently disappeared[N]
before the battle.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Is that so...[AN]
Do you really think she could[N]
be the demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It is difficult to say[N]
without even seeing her.[AN]
It will be near impossible[N]
to locate her now.[AN]
She is always clad in a black robe[N]
and none have seen her up close.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's unfortunate... But so be it.[AN]
The battle is over.[N]
That's cause enough for celebration.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I think not, milord![N]
The hardest part has yet to come.[AN]
The land must be nursed back to[N]
health now that the war is over.[AN]
There are countless people in[N]
need of our assistance.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're right![N]
We have work to do.[AN]
The real battle is[N]
only just beginning.[AN]
We must look to the future.[AN][ToggleSmile]
No matter what hardships we may face,[N]
we must never give up.[AN]
We must prove that a land of beauty[N]
and peace from human hands is possible![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
I live to serve you, Lord Roy![AN][Clear]
Now, let us make our way home.[AN]
We must spread the word of[N]
our victory![AN][X]
