[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya]
[ToggleSmile]Sir Jahn, Idunn is here.[N]
I leave her in your care.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
And what about you, human?[N]
What will you do now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I will stay here. I will face the[N]
Etrurian Army...and my destiny.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Do you have sufficient troops?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
The wyvern riders scattered around[N]
the continent have returned to us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have any chance[N]
of victory?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...Our chance of victory is[N]
minuscule at best.[AN]
But we are the Bern Army, the[N]
strongest force in Elibe.[AN]
If nothing else, we shall show[N]
them our unwavering will.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Your will...?[AN]
You humans are incomprehensible[N]
to us at times.[AN]
Do you expect your will alone[N]
to earn you victory?[AN]
But so be it.[AN]
I leave you to your irrational[N]
pursuit.[AN][X]

## Ch23_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Have you given the[N]
troops my message?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, General Brunnya.[AN]
I told them they are free[N]
to leave if they so wish.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]How many remain?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Nearly all of the soldiers say they[N]
still wish to fight for you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Nearly all of them?[AN]
Victory is unlikely.[AN]
I'm sure many of the troops have[N]
family awaiting their return.[AN]
I do not want any to feel that[N]
they must fight on this day.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We are knights of Bern, General.[AN]
We have no intention of bowing our[N]
heads to Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...Dismiss the injured and those with[N]
young children or elderly parents.[AN]
They are forbidden from fighting[N]
in this battle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]But General Brunnya...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That is an order.[N]
Go.[AN][X]

## Ch23_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, the troops[N]
are prepared.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...Did the messenger return?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, but as expected, the[N]
enemy refuses to surrender.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Was it clear that their safety would[N]
be guaranteed if they surrender?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but even given that information,[N]
they apparently politely refused.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why do they fight?[N]
Bern's king is defeated...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere...[.....]
Do you understand why?[AN]
[OpenLeft]I do very well.[AN]
...Bern recognizes itself as[N]
the strongest force in Elibe.[AN]
Their pride does not allow them to[N]
accept defeat without a fight.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]Lord Roy![N]
The enemy is advancing![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
...They leave us no choice.[N]
We must fight![AN]
Merlinus, send Princess[N]
Guinivere to the back lines...[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]No. I will stay here.[AN]
I...must listen to their cries.[AN]
That is all I can do to atone[N]
for my betrayal...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir...[N]
Fancy meeting you here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-what are you doing[N]
in a place like this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I live here.[AN]
After all my travels around the[N]
world, I decided to settle here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Uncle... I must tell[N]
you something.[AN]
Mother... She...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Your father told me.[AN]
I'm sorry I couldn't[N]
be with you.[AN]
I'm sure it must have[N]
been difficult...[AN]

What are you doing[N]
here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I fight with the Etrurian Army...[N]
What about you, Karel?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I live here.[AN]
I've traveled enough.[N]
It was time to settle down.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Karel...[N]
I must tell you something.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]About Karla?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...You already know?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir told me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I beg your forgiveness![N]
I could do nothing...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't blame you.[N]
It is I who should apologize.[AN]
If only I could have been[N]
there with you...[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
S-Sir Karel![AN]
This place will be[N]
a battlefield...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
So I see.[AN]
I thought I could be free of[N]
war in this isolated land...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What should we do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Please don't fret.[N]
I will protect the village.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you, Sir Karel![AN]
You are truly worthy of the[N]
title of Sword Saint![AN]
We have nothing to fear with[N]
you protecting us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am just an ordinary swordsman.[AN]
Stories grow with time, so don't[N]
trust all that you've heard...[AN][Clear]
...This war seems to be even[N]
greater than I realized.[AN]
I wonder how my sister Karla[N]
fares...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I never knew you had a sister.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't seen her in years,[N]
but she fell ill some time ago.[AN]
I only hope she leads a peaceful[N]
life with her husband and daughter...[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Fir?[N]
Is that you?[AN]
What are you[N]
doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I never expected to find[N]
you here, Uncle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I've traveled enough. I decided it[N]
was time to settle down.[AN]
I had hoped to train my sword without[N]
distractions in this quiet village...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uncle...[N]
I must tell you something.[AN]
Mother... She...passed on...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...She's gone?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
So she succumbed to[N]
her illness...[AN]
I'm sorry.[AN]
I wasn't there when you[N]
needed me the most.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]No... It's all right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But why are you here?[AN]
Surely you haven't been searching[N]
for me just to tell me that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Actually, I'm fighting[N]
against Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You...joined the war?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I know that you dislike getting[N]
caught up in conflicts like this.[AN]
All I wanted was to help the people[N]
who have suffered from this war.[AN]
Uncle... Was I wrong? Was I[N]
mistaken in joining this fight?[AN]
Should I have found a better way[N]
to train my sword...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, you've made no[N]
mistakes.[AN]
A path you choose on your[N]
own is never wrong.[AN]
In fact, I think I'll[N]
join you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Absolutely.[AN]
...You have grown so[N]
much.[AN]
The last time I saw you,[N]

What are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
I fight with[N]
the Etrurian Army.[AN]
I didn't expect to[N]
see you here...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I've traveled enough. I decided it[N]
was time to settle down.[AN]
I had hoped to train my sword without[N]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I have something I must[N]

[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Are you talking about Karla?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[N]
I did all I could, but...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]She succumbed to her illness...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Forgive me![N]
I was too weak to save her...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It is not your fault.[N]
It is I who should apologize to you.[AN]
I wasn't at her side when she[N]
needed me the most...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...I wish to ask you a favor.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I want this battle to end.[AN]
I know how you despise warfare...[N]
but will you lend us your skills...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...So that's it.[AN]
Very well.[N]
You have my sword.[AN]

## Ch23_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Sanctuary...[N]
The Dark Priestess is in here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Almost assuredly.[N]
But...something is bothering me...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What's that?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
Legends of the Scouring say the Dragon[N]
Sanctuary has the power of the dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The sanctuary's power is said to[N]
protect the dragons themselves.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[N]
I don't understand.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I believe the dragons in the sanctuary[N]
may be more powerful than those outside.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you think we still have[N]
a chance against them?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably, but only with the[N]
legendary weapons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...It is better to be safe than sorry.[AN]
I'll take those of us who can wield[N]
legendary weapons into the sanctuary.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Choose wisely.[AN]
Once inside, we may be[N]
unable to leave freely...[AN][X]
