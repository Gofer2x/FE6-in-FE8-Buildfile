## Ch24_Start
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Sanctuary...[N]
The air feels strange.[AN]
Did the Eight Legends fight[N]
under these conditions, too?[AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn]
You humans stand[N]
against us once more.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What...?[N]
Who are you?![AN]
When did you...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I am Jahn.[AN]
I am the last true dragon[N]
of the Dragon Sanctuary.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]The last true dragon?[AN]
You do seem different from[N]
the other dragons...[AN]
Are you the demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The "dragons" you have fought[N]
thus far are war dragons.[AN]
They know nothing but battle.[AN]
The demon dragon too is quite a[N]
different being than I.[AN]
I am a pure-blooded dragon who fought[N]
you humans in the distant past.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The demon dragon is a[N]
different being?[AN]
I thought the demon dragon[N]
was the leader of your kind.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The demon dragon is nothing more[N]
than a tool to rally us dragons.[AN]
It is hardly what I would call[N]
a leader.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.....] What exactly is[N]
the demon dragon, then?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is much you don't know,[N]
it appears.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What is the demon dragon?[AN]
I want to at least know what[N]
it is we are fighting against![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hrmm...[AN]
I have no reason to tell you.[AN]
But then, I have no reason[N]
not to tell you, either.[AN]
What to do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...Very well.[AN]
A test. Are you worthy of[N]
hearing the truth?[AN]
I await you deep within.[AN]
Fight through the hordes of[N]
war dragons and come to me.[AN]
Do that, and everything will[N]
be made clear.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You're deep within?[N]
But you're right here![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What you see is an illusion.[N]
A projection.[AN]
Come if you wish to know[N]
the truth.[AN]
Prove yourself worthy of my time[N]
and I shall tell you all...[AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
Is this really you[N]
this time?[AN]
Or...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
This is but the beginning.[AN]
You have quite a way ahead[N]
of you yet.[AN]
But you didn't perish[N]
immediately.[AN]
That alone speaks to your[N]
ability.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We have been through[N]
many trials.[AN]
We will not die here[N]
and let it be for naught.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you say.[AN]
Allow me to tell you a little[N]
bit about the demon dragon.[AN]
The demon dragon is not the leader[N]
of the dragons as you thought.[AN]
The demon dragon was created to[N]
bring us victory.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
It was created...?[AN]
So it wasn't the demon dragon[N]
who was making dragons...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The "dragons" you speak of are in[N]
fact soulless war dragons.[AN]
As I said before, they are different[N]
from pure dragons such as myself.[AN]
The war dragons are indeed created[N]
by the demon dragon.[AN]
The demon dragon was formed from[N]
a divine dragon,[AN]
the most powerful of our kind.[AN]
[OpenRight]
It was formed from a[N]
divine dragon?[AN]
Did a divine dragon agree to[N]
become the demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Agree? Ha. No.[AN]
We destroyed its very soul[N]
to extinguish its will.[AN]
It is a mindless drone intended[N]
to heed our every word.[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]You what...?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
We desperately needed the[N]
power of a divine dragon.[AN]
The survival of our entire[N]
species was at stake.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You needed the power of a[N]
divine dragon...[AN]
So...you destroyed one's[N]
soul?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you wish to[N]
know more?[AN]
Come further.[AN]
Show me your[N]
strength...[AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not bad. Not bad at all.[AN]
I'm curious how far you[N]
will make it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to hear more.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No matter how many of your kind[N]
we defeated in combat,[AN]
you humans continued to multiply[N]
endlessly.[AN]
We were eventually overwhelmed[N]
by the sheer number of you humans.[AN]
It was then we decided to form a demon[N]
dragon capable of creating war dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
War dragons... Soulless beings[N]
who know nothing but battle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Correct.[AN]
The divine dragons, however,[N]
were opposed to the idea.[AN]
They said it was an affront[N]
to the laws of nature.[AN]
As we tried to persuade[N]
the divine dragons,[AN]
they suddenly disappeared[N]
without a trace.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
They probably chose to leave before[N]
we could take advantage of them.[AN]
We never located the majority of[N]
the divine dragon tribe,[AN]
but we were able to capture a[N]
single member of their kind.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]And that became the[N]
demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Precisely.[AN]
The divine dragon Idunn was to[N]
become the demon dragon.[AN]
It hesitated, however,[AN]
as the rift between its tribe[N]
and the rest of us widened.[AN]
Hesitation... Such folly[N]
is reserved for you humans.[AN]
It serves no end.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Her hesitation impeded[N]
your plans...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Idunn was immature, but of enough[N]
strength to fulfill our purpose.[AN]
Its heart, however, wasn't with us.[N]
It would not follow our commands.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
So...that's why you[N]
destroyed her soul...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[AN]
We destroyed its soul so that it would[N]
unquestioningly obey our every command.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's...vile...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's enough for now.[AN]
Show me more of your power if[N]
you want to hear the rest![AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
You proceed at a good pace.[N]
But you have not won yet.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Rest assured, we[N]
will reach you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your soul is strong.[AN][Clear]
What do you wish to[N]
hear next?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You created the demon dragon.[AN]
The demon dragon had the ability[N]
to create endless war dragons.[AN]
Why, then, did you lose to[N]
the humans?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The demon dragon created many war[N]
dragons for use in the battlefield.[AN]
The tables were turned.[N]
Our victory was in sight.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
However, the humans soon found out[N]
about the demon dragon.[AN]
They concluded that their numbers[N]
were not enough to defeat us.[AN]
They focused their efforts into forging[N]
weapons that would pierce our scales.[AN]
They are what you humans call the[N]
legendary weapons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That much I know...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The strongest human warriors were chosen[N]
to wield their newly crafted weapons.[AN]
They came and attacked this sanctuary.[AN]
However, the immense power of the[N]
weapons clashing with our own power...[AN]
It caused something none of us had[N]
anticipated.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The laws of nature started to collapse.[AN]
Snow began to fall in summer.[N]
Stars shone in the middle of day...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You mean it caused the Ending Winter?[AN]
I thought it occurred because the dragons[N]
released vast amounts of energy...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that how your legends go?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The power of the legendary weapons[N]
was used to restore order to nature.[AN]
That's what I learned.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
So in other words, we were the cause[N]
of everything bad that happened.[AN]
How typical of you humans.[AN]
But the truth is as I said.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Then the legendary weapons were sealed[N]
away to prevent another disaster...[AN]
The traps that were protecting them[N]
were meant to keep us out...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You humans sealed them away?[N]
An uncharacteristically good decision.[AN]
But you seem to be wielding them now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't worry.[AN]
The weapons' potency seems to have[N]
decreased since their initial forging.[AN]
I doubt they can bring about another[N]
such disaster as they are now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, the warping of nature's laws[N]
dealt a great blow to us dragons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]How?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
That disaster was the reason[N]
we lost to the humans...[AN]
I shall continue my story when[N]
you advance a bit further...[AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]You have come far.[N]
Perhaps I underestimated you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please continue the story.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
When the order of nature collapsed,[N]
we dragons suffered the most.[AN]
With nature weakened, we could not[N]
maintain our dragon forms.[AN]
And so, we sealed our power into[N]
gemstones and took human form.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The dragonstones...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[AN]
We were utterly powerless against[N]
the humans.[AN]
In human form, we were even more[N]
feeble than the humans themselves.[AN]
The humans took the opportunity[N]
to slaughter us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Why did you choose the form of humans?[N]
Why not some other shape?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
In the new order of nature,[AN]
the human form required the least[N]
energy to transform into.[AN]
The Eight Legends mercilessly crushed us[N]
as we were helpless in our human form.[AN]
I too suffered deep wounds.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you hate the humans[N]
because of that attack?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hate? Only humans feel such[N]
preposterous emotions.[AN]
We battled for survival[N]
and we lost.[AN]
There was nothing more to[N]
our fight.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
However, we may yet be[N]
victorious.[AN]
A human named Zephiel[N]
resurrected the demon dragon.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Then Zephiel really did undo[N]
the demon dragon's seal![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is correct.[AN]
Show me if you're[N]
worthy to hear more.[AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump5
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Jahn![N]
Where are you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn]Hm...[AN]
I should have expected this of[N]
the man who defeated Zephiel...[AN]
You may even have the chance[N]
to fight me personally.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
How did Zephiel know about[N]
the demon dragon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Surely you know that Hartmut of[N]
the Eight Legends founded Bern.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I do.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you also know that Hartmut[N]
chose to spare the demon dragon?[AN]
Rather than killing it, he[N]
sealed it away.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't[N]
know why.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Let me explain.[AN]
The Eight Legends defeated our leader,[AN]
and made their way into the sanctuary[N]
to find the demon dragon.[AN]
However, arriving at its chamber, all[N]
they found was a blank-eyed human girl.[AN]
That was Idunn.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]She didn't fight?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
The demon dragon had its soul destroyed[N]
to follow our leader's commands.[AN]
With our leader dead, there were no[N]
commands to follow.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then what happened?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Eight Legends naturally[N]
hesitated.[AN]
They had expected to find the[N]
most terrible of all dragons,[AN]
but instead they found a[N]
mute girl.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
Knowing the demon dragon still had to be[N]
defeated, they readied their weapons.[AN]
Idunn must have reacted to their[N]
attack out of instinct.[AN]
It changed into dragon form and fought[N]
as the soulless war dragons do.[AN]
Hartmut, however,[AN]
brandished a blade even more powerful[N]
than the legendary weapons.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Binding Blade![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know what you humans call it,[N]
but that must be it.[AN]
When the blade cut the demon dragon's[N]
flesh,[AN]
it fell unconscious rather[N]
than dying.[AN][X]

## Ch24_LoreDump6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You have come far.[N]
I am in the next chamber.[AN]
It has been ages since I've[N]
shown a human my true form.[AN]
I've not left this sanctuary[N]
since the end of the Scouring.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Y...you've been here[N]
that long?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]For one thousand years...[AN]
Having survived the Scouring,[N]
I waited, healing my wounds.[AN]
I waited for the resurrection[N]
of the demon dragon.[AN]
For our chance of victory.[AN]
At long last, that time came.[AN]
The demon dragon's seal was[N]
broken,[AN]
and I felt power flowing[N]
through my veins again.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What does the demon dragon's seal[N]
have to do with your strength?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Dragon Sanctuary's power is[N]
intertwined with the demon dragon's.[AN]
With the demon dragon sealed, the[N]
sanctuary, and myself, were crippled.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
After I recovered, I sought the[N]
person who had broken the seal.[AN]
I used my illusions to seek him[N]
out and ask his intentions.[AN]
With you humans ruling the world,[N]
I couldn't go in my true form.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait... I thought that dragons lose[N]
most of their power in human form.[AN]
How do you have the power to create[N]
illusions like this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
This sanctuary is the only place that[N]
dragons maintain some power in human form.[AN]
I am also a relatively powerful dragon.[AN]
Even in human form, as long as I am in this[N]
sanctuary, illusions are a simple task.[AN]
I lack the power to create war dragons[N]
like the demon dragon can, however.[AN][X]

## Ch24_EndFaeAlive
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
The demon dragon[N]
lies ahead...[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][LoadFae]...Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Fae?[AN]
You look like you're[N]
about to cry.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Am...am I evil, too...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]When...[AN]
When I get older, will I[N]
be a bad dragon, too?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Slow down, Fae.[AN]
Where did you get[N]
that idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
That man said that...dragons and[N]
humans can't live in peace...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
That wasn't true. You've lived in[N]
Nabata with humans, haven't you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But the demon dragon is a[N]
divine dragon like me![AN]
You're going to fight the demon[N]
dragon, but what about me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What if...when I grow up...[N]
I'm like the demon dragon...?[AN]
Then...you'd have to...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, Fae.[AN]
I know you'll never be like[N]
the demon dragon.[AN]
You'll always live with[N]
humans. With people like me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you really[N]
think so?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![AN]
I want to help the[N]
demon dragon, too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Help her?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The demon dragon isn't acting[N]
of her own free will.[AN]
She had her soul destroyed.[N]
She is a slave.[AN]
I...I don't want to kill[N]
her if I can avoid it...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Your words are too big.[N]
I don't understand.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sure you'll learn what I mean[N]
once you get a little older.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][Clear]
Hartmut posed a question when he[N]
bound the demon dragon.[AN]
And I intend to answer it![AN][X]

## Ch24_End2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The demon dragon is here...[N]
Exercise caution, everyone.[AN]
This is our last battle![AN][X]
