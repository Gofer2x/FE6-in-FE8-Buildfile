## Ch6_Start1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]I snuck in here no problem, but[N]
there's nothing worth stealing![AN]
Hmm, looks like the north hall has all[N]
the valuables, but with that security--[AN][Clear]
...Are those footsteps?[AN][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWagner][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I trust everything is under control.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Sir Wagner, the soldiers are[N]
stationed all around the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Once they're inside and have their guard[N]
down, ambush them, just as with Lord Orun.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I want Princess Guinivere alive.[AN]
The rest you can do with[N]
as you wish.[AN]
Now go.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ha ha ha ha...[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]First the Silver Wolf's granddaughter,[N]
and now Princess Guinivere...[AN]
With so much to offer, Bern is certain[N]
to allow us to join them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCath][MoveMidRight]Hmmm...[.....][N]
Now isn't that interesting.[AN][X]

## Ch6_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Finally we can get a good[N]
night's rest, Lord Roy![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wonder.[AN]
That man said he was[N]
Lord Orun's advisor...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Wagner? Did something[N]
seem wrong with him?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]He seemed to be in control of[N]
everything, as if he were the lord.[AN]
And Lord Orun is so ill he can't[N]
even meet his guests?[AN]
It all seems strange...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Now that you mention it,[N]
you have a point.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadSaul][CloseSpeechFast]Excuse me, Lord Roy.[AN]
There seem to be an awful lot of[N]
soldiers patrolling the castle.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDorothy]I think they're spying on us.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[N]
No...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadCath][CloseSpeechFast]You noticed?[N]
Not bad.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Who's there?![N]
Show yourself, intruder![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hi![AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]And...who might you be?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Aw, I'm not one to talk about myself.[AN]
I overheard that Wagner guy[N]
in the main hall though.[AN]
He said they're gonna ambush[N]
you guys.[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Orun would never do that![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, he's dead, I think.[AN]
Wagner assassinated him[N]
or something.[AN]
[OpenRight]What?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He wants to capture you all[N]
and turn you over to Bern.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadMerlinus][ToggleSmile]Wait, Lord Roy![AN]
We can't trust her word[N]
so easily![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's up to you whether you[N]
trust me or not.[AN]
But don't say I didn't[N]
warn ya![AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadGuinivere][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Roy...[N]
If what she says is true...[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's spring his trap.[N]
We'll pretend like we're leaving.[AN]
If Wagner is after us, he'll try[N]
to persuade us to stay.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you wanna get out,[N]
go through the north hall![AN]
That'll bring you to the courtyard,[N]
so you'll be outta here in no time.[AN]
Good luck![AN][X]

## Ch6_Start3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWagner][OpenFarRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Lord Roy![N]
Where are you off to?[AN]
I will escort you back into the[N]
castle. Please follow me.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]My apologies, Sir Wagner.[AN]
I have just received a report[N]
of grave importance.[AN]
Please excuse us, but we must[N]
take our leave now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Surely you would appreciate a warm bed[N]
after being in the field for so long.[AN]
Lord Orun would be furious with me if you[N]
left without accepting our hospitality.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Don't worry, I shall tell Lord Orun[N]
myself that you are not to blame.[AN]
I ought to at least offer him[N]
a greeting anyway.[AN]
Please show us to his room.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]As I said, milord, Lord Orun is[N]
ill and cannot accept guests.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]If we cannot see him,[N]
then we must be off.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]There's nothing I can offer[N]
to make you stay?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]You leave me no choice then![AN]
Guards! Attack![AN]
Kill them all, but leave[N]
Princess Guinivere alive![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]The girl was right! They[N]
were trying to ambush us![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul]Lord Roy![AN]
If we go this way, we'll be leaving[N]
our rear open to attack![AN]
[OpenFarRight]Then we'll seize the whole castle![N]
Everyone, follow my lead![AN][X]

## Ch6_CathAppears
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][FastPrint]Hoo-boy, they're at each[N]
other's throats now.[AN]
Time to pilfer what I can now[N]
that security's busy.[AN][X]

## Ch6_SueNoise
[OpenMidRight][LoadSue][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]All that noise...[AN]
A battle?[N]
What is going on out there?[AN][X]

## Ch6_RoyRecruitsSue
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who are you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What's a girl doing in here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You aren't with the castle?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Roy.[N]
Who are you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Sue. Are you the one[N]
causing that noise outside?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Noise?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The noise of a battle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, I guess so.[AN]
We're fighting the[N]
castle guards.[AN]
It's a bit of[N]
a long story...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see.[N]
Then I will join your side.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]You will?[N]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]The soldiers of this castle[N]
have wronged me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[N]
What do you mean...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Please give me a bow.[N]
I will fight with you.[AN][X]

## Ch6_EndSue
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...You're the granddaughter of one[N]
of the chieftains of Sacae?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My grandfather is the strongest[N]
warrior in Sacae.[AN]
People call him the[N]
Silver Wolf.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Silver Wolf...[N]
I've heard tales of him.[AN]
But what are you doing in Lycia?[N]
This is a long way from Sacae.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern invaded Sacae, so the Kutolah[N]
clan decided to take up arms.[AN]
Grandfather had the women and[N]
children escape to Lycia, but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There was a traitor.[AN]
[CloseSpeechFast]The Djute clan, who turned to[N]
Bern's side, ambushed us.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]We were all separated.[AN]
I found my way into this land and[N]
I was rescued by Lord Orun.[AN]
But Wagner, his advisor, assassinated[N]
Lord Orun and took over the castle.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]And that's when you[N]
were captured...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is your army fighting Bern?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we will fight for[N]
as long as it takes.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Then let me join you.[AN]
Fighting Bern may lead[N]
me to Grandfather.[AN]
Lord Orun deserves[N]
vengeance as well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We're headed for Ostia, in the west.[AN]
Sacae is in the east, the opposite[N]
direction. Is that all right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't mind.[AN]
No matter where we are, Mother Earth[N]
and Father Sky watch over me.[AN][X]

## Ch6_End
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy! The spy I sent to[N]
Ostia has just returned.[AN]
He says that Ostia is in[N]
a state of anarchy![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?! Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's been a rebellion among those[N]
who want to surrender to Bern.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is Lilina safe?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The spy says that she has[N]
been taken hostage.[AN]
The rebels already took over Castle Ostia[N]
and are fighting the loyalist soldiers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We must hurry to Ostia![N]
Lilina... Please be safe![AN][X]
