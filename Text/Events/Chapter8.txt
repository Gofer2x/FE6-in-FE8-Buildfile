[MoveMidRight]The enemy has broken[N]
into the castle?![AN]
How could Debias have[N]
failed against them?![AN]
Were those Ilian mercenaries[N]
that skilled?[AN]
...Or was the Lycian Army larger[N]
than we expected...?[AN]
Whatever the case, they have broken into[N]
the impregnable Castle Ostia![AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]We must defeat them here, or we'll[N]
be a laughing stock in Bern...[AN][Clear]
You over there![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, General![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Have the troops take defensive positions[N]
throughout the castle![AN]
Particularly around the throne room![AN]
We must not allow the Lycian Army[N]
any further into the castle![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, General![AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]One other matter.[AN]
I want you to have Lilina quietly[N]
assassinated during the battle.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]What? ...I thought we[N]
were to keep her alive.[AN]
[OpenRight]I felt she might make[N]
a valuable hostage.[AN]
But many of our rebel soldiers[N]
still swear loyalty to her.[AN]
If we openly use her as a hostage,[N]
those soldiers may turn.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]If that's the case, General, would they not[N]
also turn if we assassinate her?[AN]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]That's why I said to do[N]
it quietly, isn't it?![AN]
Kill her discreetly, and say that[N]
she was hit by a stray arrow.[AN]
We can hold the enemy responsible![N]
Now go![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, General...[AN][X]

## Ch8_Start2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][.....]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAstolfo]...General Roy of Pherae,[N]
I presume.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Who are you?![N]
An enemy?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no. I'm on your side.[N]
My name is Astolfo.[AN]
I used to work here in the[N]
service of the marquess.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]What kind of work were[N]
you doing exactly?[AN]
You certainly aren't dressed[N]
like a servant...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]A bit nosy, don't you[N]
think, old man?[AN]
I'm a spy, see.[AN]
I gather information, steal things,[N]
check on people... Things like that.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]That explains it.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm not much of a spy if you can tell I[N]
work for a noble at first glance, am I?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been running around Lycia gathering[N]
intelligence for about a month now.[AN]
When I heard about Araphen, I got back[N]
as quickly as my legs would allow.[AN]
And what do I find but those muttonheads[N]
Legance and Debias inciting rebellion![AN]
I couldn't save Lord Hector, but I[N]
won't let them take Lady Lilina.[AN]
[OpenRight]Then you'll join us?[N]
Do you know where Lilina is?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Of course. Finding that[N]
stuff out is my job.[AN]
Lady Lilina is locked in a small room[N]
in the heart of the castle.[AN]
And Legance is sitting on the[N]
throne like he owns the place.[AN]
[OpenRight]We have to hurry then.[AN]
We must defeat the rebels and save Lilina[N]
before Narcian arrives from Bern![AN][X]

## Ch8_LilinaNoise
[OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's all that noise?[N]
Is there a battle going on?[AN]
I wish I could see outside[N]
this chamber...[AN][X]

## Ch8_OstiaSquadAppears
[OpenFarRight][LoadOgier][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Sir Barthe,[N]
it's a dead end![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][CloseSpeechFast]This wall has cracks in it.[AN]
We can break it down if we hit[N]
it with our weapons.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadGwendolyn]I wonder where[N]
Lady Lilina is.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a pretty good idea[N]
of where she might be.[AN]
I've known this castle[N]
for a long time.[AN]
I do wonder what's causing[N]
all the noise, though.[AN]
[OpenRight]The Lycian Army, perhaps?[AN]
My brother must be[N]
with them...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...We can't be sure he's[N]
still alive.[AN]
You had best keep your[N]
hopes low.[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Ah...[N]
Yes, you're right.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Barthe, must you[N]
be so aloof?[AN]
Bors is Gwendolyn's only brother.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]We must always stand[N]
firmly in reality.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]But--[AN]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]It's all right, Ogier.[N]
Sir Barthe is right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As a knight of Ostia,[N]
you must always remain calm.[AN]
It matters not how grave the[N]
situation.[AN]
Understood, Gwendolyn?[AN]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]...Yes, sir.[AN][X]

## Ch8_CathAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath]Oh baby![AN]
Just as I thought.[N]
They're at it again.[AN]
How stupid can these[N]
nobles get?[AN]
I'll never understand what fun[N]
it is fighting all the time.[AN]
Oh well. I'll take the opportunity[N]
to swipe what I can.[AN][X]

## Ch8_RoyLilinaTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]Lilina![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina]...Roy?[.....]
Is it really you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, it's me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You came![N]
Thank you so much.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm so glad you're unhurt.[N]
Here, take this spell tome.[AN]
Use it to defend yourself for[N]
the time being.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thanks.[AN][X]

## Ch8_BorsGwendolynTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][NormalPrint]Bors!
You're all right![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBors][FastPrint]Is that you, Gwendolyn?[AN]
I'm so glad to see[N]
you in one piece.[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Wha...!? What...what's[N]
that you're wearing?![AN]
Did you join up with[N]
the Ostian knights?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Actually, yes.[N]
I was knighted just yesterday.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What are you thinking...?[AN]
I told you to leave the fighting[N]
to me and live as you wish![AN]
You didn't need to become[N]
a knight...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I thought about it, and I[N]
realized that this is what I want.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't want to sit idly by and wait[N]
for you to return from battle.[AN]
I want to be a great knight,[N]
just like you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Bors?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You've always been a[N]
stubborn one, Gwendolyn.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Live as you wish.[AN]
If Mother and Father were alive,[N]
I'm certain they'd say the same...[AN]
But the life of a knight[N]
is never easy![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm prepared![N]
I'm ready for the challenge![AN][X]

## Ch8_BorsLilinaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
Lady Lilina![N]
You are unharmed![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors, I'm sorry that[N]
I worried you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, milady![N]
You are well...[AN]
That in itself is[N]
enough for me.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors.[AN]
And you kept your promise[N]
to protect Roy.[AN]
I knew I could[N]
depend on you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, milady![AN][X]

## Ch8_BartheLilinaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBarthe]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina![N]
I am overjoyed to see you safe.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe, you were right.[N]
Legance was planning this rebellion.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[AN]
If only I'd trusted your word,[N]
this would not have happened...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No...[AN]
Lady Lilina, you have[N]
nothing to apologize for.[AN]
Legance betrayed your[N]
kindness and trust.[AN]
He is the one responsible[N]
for this.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]It is your undying kindness that we[N]
soldiers respect the most, milady.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Barthe...[AN][X]

## Ch8_EndLilinaAlive
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]We've finally retaken[N]
the castle, Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Roy.[AN]
I'm glad that my father didn't have[N]
to go to the trouble.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, is my father still in Araphen?[AN]
I heard there was a horrible battle there,[N]
but how much longer will he be?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[N]
You haven't heard?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heard what?[AN]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector...[N]
passed on.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry... By the time we arrived[N]
at Castle Araphen...[AN]
It was already under Bern's control.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not your fault...[N]
Don't apologize.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Hector had been fatally[N]
wounded when we arrived.[AN]
If only we had gotten there sooner,[N]
we could have helped him...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...[N]
I...was prepared for this...[AN]
I'm the daughter of[N]
a warrior.[AN]
I've been taught to steel myself[N]
in times such as these.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Everybody kept it from me...[N]
They didn't want to hurt me...[AN]
But I'm strong... I can[N]
handle this...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina, you don't have[N]
to hold back...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We'll get through this...[N]
I'm here for you.[AN][X]
