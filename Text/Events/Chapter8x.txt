[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadHenning][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]B-Boss![N]
An army's in the cave![AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?![AN]
How many of them are there?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Dunno, Boss.[N]
Not too many, I hope...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's strange, though...[AN]
The lords of Lycia have bigger fish[N]
to fry than bandits like us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well?[N]
What do we do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I don't expect they know[N]
much about this cave.[AN]
Just lure them onto the lava[N]
geysers and get rid of 'em.[AN][X]

## Ch8x_Start2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, this way![AN]
The legendary weapon is on the other[N]
side of this flaming crevice.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]Lilina, are you all right? Have you[N]
already come to terms with everything?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[ToggleSmile]maybe not just yet.[N]
But I can't afford to be in sorrow.[AN]
Ostia needs me to protect it, just[N]
as it needed my father before me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm just glad you're[N]
all right, Lilina.[AN][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Only because you're[N]
with me, Roy...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]What?[AN]
Did you just say something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[AN]
Let me tell you what I know[N]
about the weapon.[AN]
The sword here was used by Roland[N]
himself, one of the Eight Legends.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Roland...[N]
The first marquess of Ostia?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly. He's my ancestor.[AN]
This sword is called Durandal,[N]
the Blazing Blade.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Durandal... The name has a[N]
strange echo to it.[AN]
So Roland used Durandal to fight[N]
the dragons during the Scouring?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's how the legend goes.[AN]
They also say that after the war ended,[N]
Roland returned to his home of Ostia.[AN]
He raised Durandal high above his head,[AN]
and the earth scorched by the flames of[N]
war suddenly blossomed with life again.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... That sword has[N]
quite the story to it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's a weapon that can defeat dragons,[N]
so it must have some exceptional powers.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh, yes. I heard that a group[N]
of bandits has made its base here.[AN]
Will the sword be all right? Might the[N]
bandits have taken Durandal?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no, don't worry[N]
yourself about that.[AN]
Only descendants of Roland know how to[N]
remove Durandal from its sheath.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's reassuring.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]All that's left then is to rid this cave[N]
of the bandits and take Durandal.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][ToggleSmile]Roy![N]
Here it is![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]So this is Durandal...[N]
It's enormous.[AN]
I don't think many of us will[N]
be able to swing it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]History has it that Roland[N]
was a small man.[AN]
Any fighter skilled enough should be[N]
able to wield the sword.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Then if I become better with the[N]
sword, I could use it as well?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well... I don't[N]
know about that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, come now.[AN]
Have SOME confidence[N]
in me, at least![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hee hee![AN][X]

## Ch8x_EndLilinaDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, we have it![N]
It was under the altar.[AN]
It was no simple task to get it out,[N]
but it's in our possession now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]This is Durandal...[AN]
But was it worth[N]
Lilina's life...?[AN][X]
