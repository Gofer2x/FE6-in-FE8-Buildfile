Why do you bar my path?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...You're wrong.[AN]
Peace at the cost of humanity is[N]

His Highness willed it so.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]His Highness...[N]
You mean Zephiel![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I am awoken. I have left[N]
the darkness of my dreams.[AN]

pass, that is my duty...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You insist on fighting us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
As long as you[N]
stand in my way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Your will...seems unbreakable...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My will is His Highness's.[AN]
I awoke for the purpose of[N]
fulfilling his desires.[AN][X]

## Endgame_Start2FaeDead
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]I don't want to fight you...[N]

is gone.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It was over a thousand years old.[AN]
A great deal of energy was[N]
released in the battle we fought.[AN]
The foundations probably couldn't[N]
withstand the pressure.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Today marks the beginning[N]
of a new era.[AN][Clear]
