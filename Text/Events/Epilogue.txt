## Epilogue_Scroll7
With the help of Roy,[N][X]

Bern was rebuilt,[N][X]

with Guinivere as its queen.[N][X]

And on the day of her crowning...[N][X]

## Epilogue_RoyLilinaASupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]
Today is Princess Guinivere's[N]
crowning ceremony.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I haven't seen her in her[N]
royal garments yet,[AN]
but I'm sure she is beautiful[N]
beyond description.[AN]
Even at our first meeting,[AN]
I had no words to describe[N]
her sheer beauty.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
But she has many[N]
struggles still to come.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
After she is crowned queen of Bern,[N]
even with Etruria's support,[AN]
I'm certain there will be great[N]
unrest and plots to overthrow her.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Some may claim that she only joined[N]
Etruria to seize the throne.[AN]
It's an unfortunate reality, but to the[N]
ignorant, that is how it will appear.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
...But I'm sure she will be fine.[AN]
Under her rule, Bern will prosper[N]
like never before...[AN]
[ToggleSmile]She's too brilliant and strong[N]
to succumb to petty unrest...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[N]
I agree.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...What about you?[N]
What will you do now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?[N]
I will return to Pherae.[AN]
I'm concerned about my[N]
father's illness,[AN]
and there is much[N]
reconstruction to be done.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Um...I...[N]
What if we...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... Never mind.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]But you're returning to Pherae...[N]
That's good.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?[AN]
Will you go back to Ostia?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes. I must take my[N]
father's place.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm glad you're staying[N]
in Ostia.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Why do you say that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Because if you're in Ostia, then[N]
we can see one another any time.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[AN]
I don't know when,[N]
but some day...[AN]
I'll come for you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...I...I have to[N]
prepare, too...[AN][Clear]
But...Roy...[N]
I've always...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![AN][ToggleSmile]
The ceremony's starting.[N]
Come, Lilina![AN]
Let's see Princess...[N]
No, Queen Guinivere![AN]
This is the start of her[N]
reign as queen![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What I'm trying to say is...[N]
I've always... Wait, what?![AN]
R-Roy, wait for me![AN][ClearFace][X]

## Epilogue_GuiniveresCrowning1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight]
Princess Guinivere, you have my[N]
congratulations on your ascension.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I thank you...[AN]
But my battle is[N]
just beginning.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[AN]
I wish we didn't have to[N]
rely on Etruria.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not at all. I am grateful for[N]
their support.[AN][ToggleSmile]
There will be those, however,[AN]
who think I only joined[N]
Etruria to seize the throne.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But the most important task at[N]
hand is Bern's reconstruction.[AN]
I must regain the people's trust[N]
through my efforts.[AN]
No matter how long it takes...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
If there is anything I can do to[N]
help, please don't hesitate to ask.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you again.[N]
Perhaps I will someday.[AN]
Roy, are you...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What will you do?[AN]
Will you stay in[N]
the Etrurian Army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No, I must return to Pherae.[AN]
I am concerned about my[N]
father's illness,[AN]
and we must begin the[N]
reconstruction effort.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are returning home?[N]
I am sure that's for the best.[AN]
Still...[AN]
Someone of your ability could easily[N]
take a place in the Etrurian court.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-me?![AN]
I don't think I deserve[N]
such a position![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pherae is blessed to have[N]
such a gifted heir as you.[AN][X]

## Epilogue_GuiniveresCrowning2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]Your Highness...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please call me Guinivere.[N]
What is the matter?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Guinivere.[N]
The ceremony is about to begin![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[N]
I will be there shortly...[AN][X]

## Epilogue_GuiniveresCrowning3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, will you[N]
come with me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
You have helped me so much ever since I[N]
left Bern with the Fire Emblem in hand.[AN]
I want you to see the path Bern will[N]
take under my leadership.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[AN]
If you will have me, then it is[N]
my pleasure to accompany you.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then come...[N]
This way.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Let us see a new Bern...[.....]
And the beginning of a new era.[AN][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll1
Peace returned to the world,[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll2
and the people slowly began to recover.[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll3
As stability returned,[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll4
Elibe faced a new age of prosperity.[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll5
And thus,[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll6
the story of the many people[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll7
who mourned, wept, and laughed[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll8
during this great conflict[N][X]

## Epilogue_EndScroll9
came to a close...[N][X]






## Epilogue_FaeIdunn1
Later, in Arcadia...[N][X]

## Epilogue_FaeIdunn2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager18][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Lord Roy.[N]
It has been far too long.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, it is good[N]
to see you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Fae will be glad[N]
to see you as well.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I saw her earlier.[AN]
She is even more energetic[N]
than I remember.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
We have allowed her outside[N]
more since her return.[AN]
Perhaps that is why.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How is Idunn doing?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We succeeded in restoring[N]
her soul, and yet...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
...She's not back[N]
to normal?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fae sometimes takes her outside,[AN]
but she will do nothing without[N]
first being told to.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...[AN]
We had known for long that[N]
she had been captured.[AN]
I feared the consequences of[N]
leaving the village, however,[AN]
so I forbade any effort to[N]
rescue her.[AN]
Now, though, I wonder whether[N]
my judgment was correct...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps the humans are changing[N]
the way I think.[AN]
I will do my best to restore[N]
Idunn's heart and soul.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...You have my[N]
gratitude.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
An expression of emotion would[N]
be a promising first step...[AN]
A laugh, for example...[AN][OpenMidLeft][X]

## Epilogue_FaeIdunn3
[OpenMidRight][LoadIdunnHuman][OpenMidLeft][LoadFae]
And that is called[N]
a tree![.......][.....]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tree...[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right![.....][......]
And this tree has[N]
tasty fruit![.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fruit?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah. [......]Can you see it?[......]
It's up at the top.[.......][......]
And if you [......]shake the tree[......]
like this...[.....][MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oww![MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It fell on[N]
my head...[.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh...[......]
[OpenMidLeft]Idunn...?[......]
Did you just laugh?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Laugh...?[......]
This is a laugh?[......][......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where's Roy?[......][......]
[MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]I have to tell Roy[N]
that you laughed![......][......][X]
