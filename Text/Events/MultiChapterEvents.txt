[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ones leading the revolution are[N]

[OpenMidLeft]No...[AN]

made it public that I had died.[AN]
A look-alike corpse was placed[N]

It was all an act to make it appear that[N]

[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia said that she could detect an[N]

It may be related to the dragons Roy[N]
says he has seen with Bern.[AN]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Perhaps...[AN]
I am too old to detect[N]
such forces now myself.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Sophia can detect an evil force?[N]
What does that mean?[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia is half dragon and half human.[AN]
That gives her the ability to detect[N]
the auras emitted by other dragons.[AN]
She says, however, that she detects an[N]
unnaturally twisted force from Bern.[AN][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I think that it should be[N]
investigated further.[AN]

to join Roy so that I might learn more.[AN]

the Fire Emblem.[AN]

[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is it...[N]
a legendary weapon?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Yes. The most powerful of[N]
them all, in fact.[AN]
It was made to slay the leader of[N]

Its power was so immense that it had[N]
to be sealed away after the war.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere, the attack[N]
on Bern will commence soon.[AN]
So may I ask...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...The rest of the story.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You said King Zephiel was an outstanding[N]
pupil in everything he did...[AN]
It sounds like he would have been an[N]
ideal heir to the throne.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have no doubt.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
But still your father never[N]
looked kindly at him.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]In truth...our father began to despise[N]
Zephiel precisely because of his talent.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Why...would a father resent[N]
his own son's talent...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Our father was a man of[N]
unextraordinary skill and intellect.[AN]
Zephiel's outstanding talents made[N]
our father colder towards him.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]He was envious...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
He went as far as to tell Zephiel[N]
that he would never inherit Bern.[AN]
He said that instead, the throne[N]
would go to my future husband.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]His own father told him that?![N]
What a heartless man![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel held strong.[AN]
He always said he never cared about[N]
inheriting the throne.[AN]
But the people of Bern knew of[N]
Zephiel's genius and wanted him king.[AN]
Pressured by the public, our father[N]
lost his patience at last...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]That's when he decided[N]
to kill Zephiel...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father gave Zephiel a goblet full[N]
of a poisoned drink at a banquet.[AN]
That was the first and last time Zephiel[N]
ever accepted a drink from our father.[AN]
After returning to his room, Zephiel[N]
began to fall dreadfully ill.[AN]
For ten days and nights, Zephiel[N]
lingered between life and death.[AN]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and[N]
loyal general, saved his life.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]...The old king made no further[N]
attempts on his life?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]No. At least, not to completion...[AN]
I have heard that he schemed to have[N]
Murdock and Zephiel's mother killed.[AN]
He was scheming to murder everyone[N]
connected to Zephiel.[AN]
Upon learning of our father's intentions,[N]
Zephiel feigned death.[AN]
At his funeral service, our father leaned[N]
over the coffin to view Zephiel's body.[AN]
It was at that moment that Zephiel sprung[N]
from the coffin and...sword in hand...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I was but a child then, so naturally[N]
I could not understand what was going on.[AN]
All I knew at the time is that our father[N]
died, and Zephiel never smiled again.[AN]
Before then, he was stern at times,[N]
but always a kind and loving brother.[AN]
But after everything that happened...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I knew that someday I may[N]
have to act against him.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I...see...[AN]

He will never listen to anything I say.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Such a feat will likely[N]
