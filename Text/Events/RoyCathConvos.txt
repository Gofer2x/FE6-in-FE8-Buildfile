[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! You're...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oops...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, cut it out![AN]
Let go of my arm![AN]
Ow! That hurts![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry.[AN]
But what are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, uh, you know,[N]
this and that.[AN]
I'm a busy girl.[N]
Ha ha ha...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here?
In a battlefield?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh yes, precisely BECAUSE[N]
this is a battlefield--[AN]
Whoops, better watch my[N]
tongue...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have some[N]
ulterior motive?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that why you[N]
told us the escape route?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, what?[AN]
Sorry, I'm a little[N]
deaf in this ear![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Just who are you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry about it![N]
Forget you saw me.[AN][Clear]
Gotta go. Cheers![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait![AN][X]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ugh, you again...[N]
Er, fancy meeting you here![AN]
Ha ha ha...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You're a thief.[AN]
You shouldn't steal.[N]
It's not right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, it's fine.[N]
I only take from the rich.[AN]
No one's going to starve[N]
or anything.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That doesn't make[N]
it any better.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh really?[N]
Then let me offer you this.[AN]
You nobles take food and money from people[N]
living in what you call your land.[AN]
How is tax collection any different[N]
than tribute to a bandit?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We protect the people[N]
in return![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not![AN]
You kill them in[N]
wars like this![AN]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't start this war.[AN]
Bern invaded, so we have[N]
to defend the people...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You can't just do anything you want[N]
and say you're defending us![AN]
How does burning down villages[N]
help us anyway?![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Burning down villages?![N]
We never--![AN]
Wait a minute, was your...?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...My village was burned to[N]
the ground by our marquess.[AN]
He said that he had to do it to[N]
prepare for Bern's attack.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]But...that's...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We always had barely enough to get by,[N]
and then we lost everything...[AN]
Our homes... Our crops...[AN]
And here you come, saying[N]
it's wrong to steal?[AN]
Ha! Look who's talking![AN]
The nobility steals from the poor so you[N]
can live in luxury at our expense![AN]
[OpenMidRight]I...[N]
I don't know what to say.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh. Don't get gloomy.[AN]
I really don't like talking about[N]
how pitiful we are anyway.[AN]
But you started it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, to heck with this.[AN]
It's no fun stealing after a[N]
conversation like that.[AN][Clear]
I'm outta here.[N]
Ta-ta![AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! You![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? ...You again?[AN]
You always come and[N]
mess up my plans.[AN]
Do you have it out for[N]
me or something?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I just...wanted to apologize.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The last time we met, I was[N]
pretty callous.[AN]
I said you shouldn't steal, but I didn't[N]
even realize what you'd been through...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that? Whatever.[N]
I don't care.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I still think what[N]
you do is wrong.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You've got some nerve,[N]
you know that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Just give me[N]
a chance.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]A chance?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Once this war is over, I promise to[N]
help rebuild your village.[AN]
I'll be sure the taxes are[N]
put to good use too.[AN]
Just please, stop looting.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[AN][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
How long will that be?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Whenever this war ends.[N]
I can't say when...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And you expect me to wait[N]
patiently until then?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No. All I want[N]
is your faith.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why are you so[N]
kind to me?[AN]
I'm just a thief.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Without you, we wouldn't have[N]
escaped Wagner's trap.[AN]
Maybe you didn't care about helping us,[N]
but the fact is that you did.[AN]
You saved our lives. You're more than[N]
just a thief.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If things keep going[N]
like they have...[AN]
I guess you'll get in my way[N]
no matter where I go.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]As long as you appear[N]
in our path.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine, you win.[AN]
I'll stop looting[N]
battlefields.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You will?[N]
Thank you.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]But I'm coming[N]
with you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What?[N]
Why?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Actions speak louder[N]
than words.[AN]
Prove to me that you'll be true[N]
to your promise.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I won't disappoint you![AN][X]
