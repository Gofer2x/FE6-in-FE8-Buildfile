[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! You're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oops...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, cut it out![A]
Let go of my arm![A]
Ow! That hurts![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
But what are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, uh, you know,
this and that.[A]
I'm a busy girl.
Ha ha ha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here?
In a battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh yes, precisely BECAUSE
this is a battlefield--[A]
Whoops, better watch my
tongue...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have some
ulterior motive?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that why you
told us the escape route?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, what?[A]
Sorry, I'm a little
deaf in this ear![A]
[OpenMidRight]Just who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry about it!
Forget you saw me.[A][Clear]
Gotta go. Cheers![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ugh, you again...
Er, fancy meeting you here![A]
Ha ha ha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You're a thief.[A]
You shouldn't steal.
It's not right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, it's fine.
I only take from the rich.[A]
No one's going to starve
or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That doesn't make
it any better.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh really?
Then let me offer you this.[A]
You nobles take food and money from people
living in what you call your land.[A]
How is tax collection any different
than tribute to a bandit?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We protect the people
in return![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do not![A]
You kill them in
wars like this![A]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't start this war.[A]
Bern invaded, so we have
to defend the people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can't just do anything you want
and say you're defending us![A]
How does burning down villages
help us anyway?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Burning down villages?!
We never--![A]
Wait a minute, was your...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...My village was burned to
the ground by our marquess.[A]
He said that he had to do it to
prepare for Bern's attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...that's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We always had barely enough to get by,
and then we lost everything...[A]
Our homes... Our crops...[A]
And here you come, saying
it's wrong to steal?[A]
Ha! Look who's talking![A]
The nobility steals from the poor so you
can live in luxury at our expense![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...
I don't know what to say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh. Don't get gloomy.[A]
I really don't like talking about
how pitiful we are anyway.[A]
But you started it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, to heck with this.[A]
It's no fun stealing after a
conversation like that.[A][Clear]
I'm outta here.
Ta-ta![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[99]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! You![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? ...You again?[A]
You always come and
mess up my plans.[A]
Do you have it out for
me or something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I just...wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The last time we met, I was
pretty callous.[A]
I said you shouldn't steal, but I didn't
even realize what you'd been through...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that? Whatever.
I don't care.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I still think what
you do is wrong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've got some nerve,
you know that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just give me
a chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Once this war is over, I promise to
help rebuild your village.[A]
I'll be sure the taxes are
put to good use too.[A]
Just please, stop looting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
How long will that be?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Whenever this war ends.
I can't say when...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And you expect me to wait
patiently until then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No. All I want
is your faith.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why are you so
kind to me?[A]
I'm just a thief.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Without you, we wouldn't have
escaped Wagner's trap.[A]
Maybe you didn't care about helping us,
but the fact is that you did.[A]
You saved our lives. You're more than
just a thief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If things keep going
like they have...[A]
I guess you'll get in my way
no matter where I go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]As long as you appear
in our path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine, you win.[A]
I'll stop looting
battlefields.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You will?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I'm coming
with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Actions speak louder
than words.[A]
Prove to me that you'll be true
to your promise.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I won't disappoint you![A]
