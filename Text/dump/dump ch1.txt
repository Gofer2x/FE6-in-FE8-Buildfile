//Chapter 1




[01]

[OpenMidRight][LoadBanditKid]Boss![A]
They've all hidden themselves
inside the castle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDamas]Heh. Even Eliwood, the greatest knight in
Lycia, is no match for an illness, it seems.[A][OpenMidRight]Hee hee hee...[A]
You were right when you said
there wouldn't be many soldiers.[A]
They're all getting ready
to defend against Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course I was right.
I'm always right, you fool.[A]
But reinforcements could be
here any minute.[A][Clear]
All right, you curs, listen up![A]
Kill everyone in the castle
while we still got time![A]
Then we can waltz outta
here with all the loot![A]

[02]

[OpenMidRight][LoadScollan]Heh heh, castles ain't the only
places with loot.[A]
Let's go ransack the villages
and take everything they got![A]

[03]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadEliwood][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Eliwood![A]
We're under attack by
bandits from Mount Bolm![A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand. Thank you, Merlinus...[A]
Blast it! Were I not in this pitiful state,
I would take care of them all myself...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina][NormalPrint]Lord Eliwood...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina, you must hide yourself.[A]
This castle is going to
become a war zone.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]No, my lord.
I can fight, too![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't be absurd.[A]
I couldn't face Hector if something
happened to you in my own castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]My father?
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It's going to be all right.[A]
Roy should be here any moment, so we
just need to hold our own until then.[A]
He'll drive off these dastards.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[04]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus![A]
Send a messenger to Roy to let
him know the current situation![A]
We need his help![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Y-yes, milord![A][ClearFace]

[05]

[06]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenRight][LoadRoy][OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's Lance!
What's the matter?[A]
Why are you in such a hurry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy![A]
Bandits have appeared and are attacking
the castle as we speak![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadAlen]No!
Is the marquess unharmed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's inside, defending against
the bandits' attack.[A]
But I don't know how long he can
last with his illness...![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadBors][NormalPrint]Excuse me. Lance, is it?
Is Lady Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You must be a knight of Ostia.
Lady Lilina is in the castle.[A]
She should be all right.[A]
She's with Lord Eliwood after all,
but he can't last forever.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]No...[A]
I shouldn't have let Lilina go to
the castle before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadWolt][FastPrint]Lord Roy, regret won't solve anything!
We must retake the castle![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadMarcus]Wolt is right.
We must make haste![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Yes, you're right.
This is no time to despair.[A][Clear]
[FastPrint][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]Very well. To arms then![A]
Our target is the castle!
We must rescue everyone![A]

[07]

[OpenMidRight][LoadBanditKid]Boss![A]
They've all hidden themselves
inside the castle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDamas]Heh, even Eliwood, the greatest knight in
Lycia, is no match for an illness, it seems.[A][OpenMidRight]Hee hee hee...[A]
You were right when you said
there wouldn't be many soldiers.[A]
They're all getting ready
to defend against Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course I was right.
I'm always right, you fool.[A]
But reinforcements could be
here any minute.[A]
All right, you curs, listen up![A]
Kill everyone in the castle
while we still got time![A]
Then we can waltz outta
here with all the loot![A]

[08]

[OpenMidRight][LoadDamas][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Curses!
Reinforcements already![A]
But they'll have to go through
me to get into the castle![A]

[09]

[0A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you knights going
to the castle?[A]
I know this isn't much...[A]
But please accept this money
on behalf of all of us.[A]
Use it well![A]

[0B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4][CloseSpeechFast]We're all doomed...[A]
Soldiers from Bern have
crossed the border...[A]
They laid an awful attack.[A]
And even if the allied lords
strike back, Lord Eliwood...[A]
He can't even stand anymore...[A]

[0C]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9][CloseSpeechFast]Listen![A]
If you wanna do well in battle
you'd better use terrain wisely.[A]
For example, if you're in a forest
the trees will cover you.[A]
That'll teach your enemies who
they're dealing with.[A]

[0D]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager2][ToggleSmile]Money is vital for any army.[A]
If you don't have any, you won't be
able to replace your broken weapons.[A]
And you can't fight
without weapons![A]

[0E]

[LoadDamas][ToggleSmile]You bumbling idiots![A]
You can't take down a
few pathetic knights?![A]

[0F]

[LoadDamas][ToggleSmile]Wh...what the...?!
S...so strong...[A]

[10]

[11]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Father!
Lilina![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadEliwood][ToggleSmile]Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina]Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I'm so glad to see you both!
Thank goodness you're unharmed.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Thanks for the
rescue, Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, Father.
How is your health?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Well enough.
I've some life in me yet.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]But Roy, do you know why
I called you back here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm to take over your role by
leading the soldiers of Pherae.[A]
We must join the rest of the Lycian
Army to defend our people.[A]
[OpenLeft]Exactly.[A]
As you know, Bern has
commenced an invasion of Lycia.[A]
We are honorbound to follow
the vows of our allegiance.[A]
Lycia needs every lord's army,
and we must oblige.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Of course.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm truly sorry to interrupt your
studies and force you into this war,[A]
but I'm not well... I'm in no
condition to lead an army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Father...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLilina][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Eliwood!
I'll go with Roy![A]
My father leads
Lycia's largest army.[A]
And I'm certain my magic will
be of help to Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]No, Lilina.
You must return to Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadLilina][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A][.....]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]With Hector preparing for battle, there is
no one sitting on the throne of Ostia.[A]
It must be an uneasy feeling for the
people not to have a sitting lord.[A]
As the daughter of the marquess, you must
take the throne until Hector returns.[A]
That will put the people at ease.[A]
Do you have any objections?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...No, my lord.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Roy, I have arranged a contract with
a group of mercenaries.[A]
You are to meet them at the border to
Bern. Merlinus will accompany you.[A]
He is knowledgable and experienced and
should be of great help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for everything,
Father.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry, my son.
I have absolute faith in you![A]
Fight bravely, and show everyone who
the next marquess of Pherae is![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father![A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[12]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors, I have a
favor to ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You needn't ask, milady.[A]
I will accompany Lord Roy in his travels
and protect him with my very life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you, Bors.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

[13]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][.....]Take care, Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will.
You too, Lilina.[A]
