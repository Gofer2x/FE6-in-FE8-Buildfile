[OpenMidRight][LoadNord][ToggleSmile]What can you tell me about
that spy from the resistance?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2]You mean the dancer
called Larum?[A]
We threw her in the
dungeon, milord.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Has she told
you anything?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No. She keeps insisting that she's
not affiliated with the resistance.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A liar, is she?[A]
Perhaps I should
interrogate her myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sir Nord![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is a messenger here
from the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Ah, the army that was sent to
clean up the bandits on the Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It seems that they want permission
to pass through to Eburacum.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]...Lord Arcardo told us to get rid of
the Lycian Army in their time here.[A]
Heh heh heh... If we impress Lord Arcardo
he may see fit to reward us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Deploy the troops and
finish them here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord...[A][Clear]
And the messenger?[A]
[OpenRight]Kill him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understood, milord.[A]
[OpenRight]Be sure to deploy
the ballista.[A]
Use it to defeat the Lycian Army
before they even reach you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, milord.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just make sure the enemy
doesn't get hold of it![A]

[DE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, soldiers are
flowing out from the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Are there bandits
around here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, they seem to be
heading toward us, actually.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What about the messenger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He hasn't returned...
Which may mean the worst...[A]
[OpenMidRight]He hasn't returned?[A]
Why is Sir Nord attacking us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The enemy draws near...
Lord Roy, what are your orders?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I guess we have no
choice but to fight.[A]
We might learn something if
we can reach the castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.
You're right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, storm the castle![A]
But have mercy! Some of their soldiers
may be willing to listen![A]

[DF]

[OpenMidRight][LoadNord][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez!
Gonzalez, where are you?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][FastPrint]Here... I here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]There's a village to the north,
right along the mountain.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]It may be a resistance base.[A]
I want you to go and burn it to
the ground, village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good. You understand.[A]
This is the only use I have
for a lump such as you.[A]
Now get going, you halfwit,
before you forget your orders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Forget how to speak?
Are you trying to say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]N-no...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Such a monstrous face, and yet such
a needlessly compassionate heart.[A]
He will learn the value of
destroying a village firsthand![A]

[E1]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager41]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Geese...
You're really leaving?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The lord of that castle
killed my mates.[A]
I won't let their deaths
go unavenged.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You mean that crew that
was always with you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
They were taken to the mines and told
that they would be given work.[A]
But they were all worked like
slaves until they...[.....]died.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Maybe they weren't the brightest
bunch, but they were good people...[A]
And then they were killed...
just like that...!![A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you intend to avenge
them on your own?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is there something wrong
with that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
But I thought you were going to go
back to your merchant business.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, well, I've got bigger
problems now...[A]
Once my mates get their revenge, and
once the war subsides, maybe I will.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...We won't forget you, Geese.[A]
You and your crew risked your lives
to get us food and supplies.[A]
If you ever need anything,
we'll be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe I'll take you up on that,
if I'm still alive.[A]
...Thanks.[A]

[E4]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Excuse me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]W-what you doing?!
I am enemy![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I know...[A]
But there's such a look of
sorrow in your eyes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...There is village near
mountain. You know?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, I know it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tell people escape.
I have order. Destroy village.[A]
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What? Don't![A]
The villagers
are innocent...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]No.
It order. I must.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]It sounds to me like you should leave
the person who gave you that order.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Leave?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yes!
You can fight with us.[A]
We're protecting the villagers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...No...
I monster...[A]
People mean to me...
People throw stones...[A]
People say, "Go away!"...
"You a monster!"...[A]
Not human...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's horrible!
Of course you're human![A]
You're a very kind-hearted man.
I can tell.[A]
Please, come with us.
Don't be afraid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Me afraid? I never afraid! Everyone
afraid of ME! I not afraid![A]
[OpenMidRight]No. You ARE afraid.[A]
You're afraid that people will throw
stones and call you a monster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]But you don't have to
be afraid of us.[A]
Everyone in our army is nice. They
won't do that to you.[A]
Be brave... Take that first step, and
you'll never have to be afraid again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]

[E5]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah? What?
You got something to say to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to ask why you're fighting
against the soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who wants to know?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy, leader of the
Lycian Army.[A]
We're here on behalf
of Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're with Etruria?![A]
Then you're with the enemy.
Get ready to die![A]
[OpenMidRight]Slow down![A]
We're fighting the
castle's troops too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And yet Etruria sent you?
I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't either.[A]
We were sent by Etruria to get rid of the
bandits here, but something's strange.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You say you're fighting
the castle's troops.[A]
I'm for hire, if
you'll take me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm a seafaring man, so I know both the
land and sea around the Isles.[A]
You look a bit lost, so I could
be a good guide for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That would help,
but why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to help with
your mission.[A]
[ToggleSmile]To be honest, I'm a pirate, so I'm probably
the type you were sent to get rid of.[A]
But I only go after the rich. They have
more than their fair share anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well then, if you'll join us,
we're pleased to have you.[A]
We don't know this area at all,
so it's been difficult thus far.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds like we have a deal!
Leave it to me![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...This is it, lads.[A]
Can you taste it?
You'll have your vengeance.[A]
And after you do, I might just tag along
with this Roy fellow for a while...[A]

[E6]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager41]
[ToggleSmile]I'm worried about Larum.
I hope she's all right.[A]
She smuggled us weapons
so we could defend ourselves.[A]
Even when we begged her to hide,
she refused and kept helping us.[A][Clear]
Here's an axe that she brought us.
It's a strange one...[A]
It's strong against swords,
but weak against lances![A]
I'd gladly trade it for her safety,
though, so please, take it...[A]

[E7]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager45]
[ToggleSmile]Brigands and pirates... They were all just as
innocent as anyone when they were young.[A]
Maybe if you spoke to some of them,
you could make them understand.[A]

[E8]

[LoadNord]You made it all the
way here.[A]
But I shall take your
pathetic lives...[A]

[E9]

[LoadNord][ToggleSmile]...Death?[A][Clear]
I feel...my life...
draining...away...[A]

[EA]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...[A]
We couldn't find any evidence
explaining Sir Nord's aggression.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But now we know for certain
that somebody wants our heads.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think we should send word to
the mainland about this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'll send a message
to General Cecilia.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]Excuse me, Lord Roy.[A]
We found a girl imprisoned
in the dungeon.[A]
She wishes to speak with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To me?
Let her pass.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]You're Roy?[A]
The one who's here to clear
out the bandits?[SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, that's me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][SendToBack][CloseSpeechFast]I beg you, Roy!
Please rescue my friends![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Whoa, easy there![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][MoveLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hey!
Get off of him![A]
[OpenFarRight]C-calm down and
tell me everything.[A]
You say your friends
are in danger?[A][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]My name is Larum.[A]
I'm part of the resistance
force on the Isles.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]The force that's fighting
against the bandits?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes.[A]
...Actually, no![A]
[OpenFarRight]No?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's part of it,
but the real enemy is Etruria![A]
They work with the bandits to squeeze every
bit they can out of the people here![A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
Is that true?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]The lords living here take people into
the mines and work them to death!![A]
They're allowed no rest, even
if they're sick or injured.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That's terrible...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We're fighting Etruria
to stop this abuse![A]
Our next plan was to attack the mine at
Eburacum and rescue the people there![A]
But...but...![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Calm down!
You can tell me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A villager here leaked the
details of the plan![A]
He was probably tortured...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][SendToBack]I have to go to the mines before
the resistance is ambushed![SendToBack][A]
[OpenMidRight]Then there's no time to spare![A]
We'll help the resistance force and rescue
the people being forced into labor![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Truly, you will?!
Thank you, Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
L-Larum![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][MoveLeft]Hey!
I said get off of him![A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Here, Roy.
Use this sword.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's called a wyrmslayer.[A]
It's effective against wyvern riders, and
it's said it was used against dragons, too.[A]
Who can say, though?
It might come in handy.[A]
It belongs to Echidna, the leader
of the resistance.[A]
You're helping us though, so you
can have it for now.[A]
