[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you found that
resistance bard yet?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We have a good
lead, milord.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Out with it then.
Where is he?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's apparently in hiding
in the nearby village.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Removing Elffin the Bard will sever the
head guiding the resistance force.[A]
Find him. Burn the village to the
ground if you have to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I apologize for the
wait, Madam Melady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You seem to have...
a full plate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh, worry not, our obligations
to Bern take priority over all.[A]
If you need anything, please
don't hesitate to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Then let's get to the matter
we discussed earlier...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ah, the whereabouts
of Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Have you found anything,
Lord Zinque?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I regret to say
that I have not.[A]
Have you been to Juteaux?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I have.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then I suggest you pay
a visit to Father Orlo.[A]
He resides in the castle at
Eburacum to the north.[A]
He knows the region better than any
of us, so he may have some idea.[A]
However, if even he does not know
where Princess Guinivere might be,[A]
then she is most likely not in
the Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
I will speak with
Father Orlo then.[A]
Farewell.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The resistance is supposedly
very active in this area.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's what our
sources say.[A]
But I also hear that Etruria's military is
hunting down members of the resistance.[A]
Their numbers have apparently dwindled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Etruria does nothing about bandits but
oppresses the resistance?[A]
Something is very wrong with
this picture...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed it is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can we do anything to
help the resistance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our hands are tied...[A]
To do so would directly oppose
Etruria's nobility.[A]
We are here under Etruria's
orders, remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll send a letter to General Cecilia
and see what she has to say.[A]
Let's not do anything too
rash just yet.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy![A]
Etrurian troops are attacking the village
to find a member of the resistance force![A]
They're under orders from Lord Zinque,
the noble who controls this area.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]Oh no![A]
...But should we intervene?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We haven't the time to
await General Cecilia's reply...[A]
But I want to help the people.[A]
...Even if it means opposing
an Etrurian noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We fight![A]
Our purpose is just!
Make Lycia proud![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were you able to ascertain
Princess Guinivere's whereabouts?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately, no.[A]
But a bishop named Orlo in charge of
the mines in the north may know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Very well.
Then we head north.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Galle...
I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter
of Princess Guinivere a secret,[A]
so only I was assigned to search
for her.[A]
I'm sorry to get you mixed
up in this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you work directly under General
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Murdock agreed to allow
me to assist you.[A]
He thinks it's vital we find the
princess and the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think Princess
Guinivere has the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's what His Majesty
the king thinks.[A]
And I think he's correct,
all things considered.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Come now,
don't be like that...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...No,

[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I have a younger brother, but he left

I'm taking care of his friend's

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I understand...[A]
The most I can do to protect

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is going on out there?[A]
Why is it taking so long to find a
single member of the resistance?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the Lycian Army![A]
They've joined the battle on
behalf of the villagers...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Lycian Army?
They would betray Etruria?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Also, milord, we have received
a missive from Juteaux.[A]
The Lycian Army is suspected
of working with the bandits.[A]
Lord Arcardo has given us orders
to take them dead or alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The Lycian Army has ties with bandits?
Hah! The irony![A]
That fool only wants to save face...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, milord?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is not the mainland.
The Isles are ruled by might.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not quite sure
I understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pay it no mind.[A]
Was that all the message
from Juteaux said?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There's more.[A]
Lord Arcardo has provided
us with reinforcements.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]They should arrive soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Confound it![A]
We won't get credit for defeating Lycia
if we're aided by reinforcements![A]
We must wrap this up before they
can join the fight...[A]
Ah, I've an idea!
Get me Scollan![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadScollan]You called,
Lord Zinque?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Burn down the village.

[OpenLeft]...Can we take
the loot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do as you wish.
Just do it quickly.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You can count on us, Lord Zinque.

Where are you, Gonzalez?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez]Here...

[OpenMidRight]There's a village to the south.
With me so far?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]With you so far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good. It might be a base
for the resistance.[A]
Zinque says to burn it to the
ground, village and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Village and all...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good, you understand.
Now get goin'![A]
Don't screw this one up,

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You got a problem? Does your head

[OpenMidLeft]N-no...[A][ClearFace][......]

There's nothin' wrong with

Are we clear, wretches?
No questions?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][NormalPrint]We got it, Boss![A]
[094E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][ToggleSmile]That's the
Lycian Army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea]They were assigned to fight
against the bandits...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
But Lord Arcardo says they're
allied with the bandits now.[A]
Why they're doing exactly the opposite
of their assignment is beyond me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Thea, take your soldiers and

I'll commence the attack
from here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea]Yes, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I hear that you have

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir, I have two sisters.
One older, one younger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are they pegasus
knights like you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They are, actually.
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have a younger
sister myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Any sister of yours
must be enchanting.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, she is a sight.[A]
I heard, however, she got tangled up
in some mess and now she's missing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Oh my...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have some people looking into it,
but they've yet to find anything.[A]
If I didn't have this mission,
I would search for her myself...[A]

For your family's sake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.

[OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ready then? Let's move.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir, are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Arcardo said Ilia's pegasus
knights are expendable.[A]
They should be fighting on the
front line, not us.[A]
Surely the lives of us Etrurian
soldiers are more valuable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be ridiculous.
They are reliable companions.[A]
We will attack at the same time...
or before them, if need be.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Lord Arcardo's story
is curious, though...[A]
The army from Lycia only
arrived very recently.[A]
How could they create ties with
the bandits so quickly...?[A]
[0950]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadGenericPegasusKnight]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you ready?
We move southward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Captain...
Are you sure we'll be all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Etrurian army considers us disposable.
They may send us to our doom...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Where did you hear that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]One of the other riders was told so
by someone in the Etrurian army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pay no mind to
mere rumors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm certain Commander Klein
would never approve of that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Commander Klein's not like that.
I trust him with my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Very well.[A]
Then we'll trust him as well,
for we trust you, Captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
Let's go![A]

I just want you safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sis...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I know how brash and hotheaded you
can be, but always remember...[A]
There are people who care
about you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Here, take this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a special weapon.[A]
I nursed a traveler back to health,
and he left it in return.[A]
You can use it, can't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Sis!
I've gotta go now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Just be careful...[A]
[095F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadMary]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Mary...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lot!
You've returned?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No...
We just happened to be nearby.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh... Mieu won't
be happy about that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I've made you take care of Mieu
ever since our mother died.[A]
I'm sorry to force
that burden on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]It's not your fault...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Someday...I swear...
I swear I'll return.[A]
...Can I leave Mieu to
you until then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You swear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Don't lie like that... This is war.
You don't know if you'll come back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]But I'll be waiting...
Until eternity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, you should
take this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a special weapon.[A]
It will help you
keep your promise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I appreciate it.
Now...I must be off again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Be careful...[A]
[0960]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadMary][ToggleSmile]Have you seen my brother?[A]
His name is Ward,
and he's a mercenary...[A]
Have you at least
heard of him?[A]
Well, take this for
your trouble.[A]
[0961]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadMieu]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]It's Ward![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Hey, Mieu![A]
...Come on, can't you call me
UNCLE Ward?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...you're just Ward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, never mind.[A]
You look like you've
gotten bigger.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...It's dangerous here.
Go hide in the hills.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My sister's still here, right?
She'll take you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yeah, Auntie Mary's here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So she's Auntie Mary but
I'm just Ward, huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh.
Here you go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What's this?
A wing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It'll make you
like a bird![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Like a bird?
What's that mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like a bird. You know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No, I don't know.[ToggleSmile][A]
But, uh, anyway,
this is for me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's for
Big Brother Lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]And Lot is Big Brother Lot...
Have you got it out for me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha! I'll go see Mary.
Here's the wing.[A]
Give it to Lot, OK,
Uncle Ward?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]And NOW she calls
me Uncle...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Whoa, are you OK?!
Don't trip...[A]
[0962]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadMieu]
[OpenMidRight]Brother! You're home![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Mieu!
Have you been a good girl?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I was good!
I didn't even wet my bed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's my girl.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lot...
While you were away, Mother...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know...
She went to sleep...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Here...
Mother left this for you.[A]
She said you might
find a use for it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brother...[A]
You won't leave me,
will you?[A]
You won't go to sleep
like Mother...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course not![A]
In fact, next time you see me I'll
have a whole wagon of presents.[A]
Just listen to Mary and
stay good, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]OK![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Go hide in the hills with Mary.
It's dangerous here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I will...
[ToggleSmile]And Lot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You promised![A]
Don't leave me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't...[A][Clear][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft]At least, I hope
I won't...[A]
[0963]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadMieu]Lot?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Oh.
I'm sorry...[A]
Take this.[A]
[0964]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager39]Ah, our heroes![A]
I thank you on behalf
of the village.[A]
This is made from the
scale of a dragon.[A]
It's said it will protect the
one who uses it from harm.[A]
Please, take it.[A]
[0965]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager43]A few months ago, my
granddaughter went missing.[A]
We all searched in the
mountains and found her.[A]
She was with a hulking monster of a man, so
we threw stones at him to drive him off...[A]
Afterwards my granddaughter told me that
he was the one who led her to the village.[A]
...If you ever find that man,
would you give him this?[A]
It's a special axe that's effective
against swords.[A]
And...[......]tell him I'm sorry.[A]
[0966]
[LoadZinque]The people are suffering...?[.....]
What concern is that to me?[A]
They live to serve me.
Their wails are meaningless.[A]
[0967]
[LoadZinque]
[ToggleSmile]This is my land...
Mine alone...[A][Clear]
None...shall...[A]
[0968]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, there is a young man claiming
to be with the resistance here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll see him.
Let him pass.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I am pleased to meet you.
My name is Elffin.[A]
I am a member of the
resistance force.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You have my thanks for
saving the village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We simply did what
we believe is right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you stand
against Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so, I have
no regrets.[A]
We may have opposed Etruria's
immediate interests,[A]
but once the truth about the Isles is
out, I'm certain they will understand.[A]
I sent a letter to a trustworthy
Etrurian noble.[A]
If she takes appropriate measures,
they will send us aid.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not
be so sure...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why is that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't you find it odd that Etruria
requested your help here at all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...yes, I do.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]If I may be so bold as to guess...[A]
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...It was.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There may have been ulterior motives for
sending your army away.[A]
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was
undesirable to them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never even
considered that...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There are rumors...that Roartz and
Arcardo are working with Bern.[A]
[0969]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMary][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Are you the leader
of this army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I wish to thank you for
protecting our village.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There is no thanks necessary...
We did what we believe is right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Regardless, I want you to have this
as a token of our gratitude.[A]
[096A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier7][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein]
[OpenMidLeft]Commander Klein, we will stay and help
with reconstruction as directed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good. These people
need you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Would that we could
fight at your side.[A]
Here is the bolt we
were holding for you.[A]
You may need it more
than we do.[A]
Farewell and good luck,
Commander Klein.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.
Good luck to you as well.[A]
[096B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidLeft][LoadGenericPegasusKnight]
Captain![A]
We will return to Ilia
to make our report.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very good.
Thank you for your service.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, and take this...[A]
Your sister gave it to me
before we left.[A]
Please be careful...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.
You too.[A]
