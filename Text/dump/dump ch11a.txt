[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechFast]So Princess Guinivere isn't
in the Western Isles?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We searched every inch of the Isles,[A]
and our intelligence has learned
nothing from the Lycian Army.[A]
The princess is nowhere to be found.
I apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.
I will continue my search elsewhere.[A]
Bern thanks you for your
cooperation, Father Orlo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I pray that you find
Princess Guinivere soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][ClearFace]

[EC]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadOrlo]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Who was that,
Father Orlo?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Captain Melady. A wyvern rider from Bern
who serves Princess Guinivere.[A]
She's searching for the princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you tell her where
the princess is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course not.
Princess Guinivere is far too valuable.[A]
High Chancellor Roartz was ecstatic when
he learned the princess was in Aquileia.[A]
He had the same evil glint in his eye
when Prince Myrddin was assassinated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father Orlo![A]
You must never speak of
the assassination...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes, I must watch my tongue.[A]
Regardless, the princess is secure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's reassuring...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So, why have you
come before me?[A]
Surely not just for
court gossip?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, milord.[A]
It's regarding the village where the
leader of the resistance hides.[A]
We are prepared to attack,
so I am here for instructions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well done.[A]
Commence the attack immediately, before
any unpleasant interruptions arrive...[A]

[ED]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The resistance hideout
is in this village?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but the castle's troops
may have attacked already.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]I must say, that Orlo sounds like a
despicable wretch of a man.[A]
A bishop should preach the words
of the gods to help the people.[A]
But what he's doing is nothing
more than torture![A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]It would be best to wait for
General Cecilia's reply, but...[A][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy![A]
The castle troops are
attacking the village![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]Oh dear, no!
Lord Roy, should we attack?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]I suppose there's no time
to await the reply...[A]
The people here need our help,[A]
even if doing so means souring
our relationship with Etruria...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum]Roy...[A]
[OpenRight]We fight!![A]
Make Lycia proud of our
actions here today![A]

[EE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadGalle]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Melady, have you discovered
where Princess Guinivere is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
It appears she has left
the Lycian Army.[A]
I thought we were
so close...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was a
dead end then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Galle...
I'm sorry.[A]
King Zephiel wanted to keep the matter
of Princess Guinivere a secret,[A]
so only I was assigned to search
for her.[A]
I'm sorry to get you mixed
up in this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you work directly under General
Murdock. Surely you have other duties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Murdock agreed to allow
me to assist you.[A]
If she isn't here, then Princess
Guinivere must be on the mainland.[A]
I'll ask General Narcian for some
additional assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You're going to
bow to Narcian?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Hm?
Of course.[A]
He's one of the three
Wyvern Generals.[A]
He leads the offense on
Lycia and Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Galle, doesn't that...
frustrate you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Why should it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You were to be a Wyvern General.[A]
But Narcian put forth that you're not a Bern
native and took the title for himself.[A]
And you're going to bow down to him
and request his help?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What he said is only the truth...
I wasn't born in Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Still...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm pleased with the position
I have now.[A]
The king and General Murdock trust me,
even though I'm not of Bern by birth.[A]
To ask any more would be nothing
but greed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Galle...[A]

[EF]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]Echidna!
We know you are here![A]
You are surrounded on
all sides![A]
Drop your weapons and show
yourself immediately![A][......]

[F0]

[OpenMidRight][LoadEchidna][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][ToggleMouthMove]You are Echidna,
leader of the resistance force?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadVillager46][CloseSpeechFast]Echidna, I'm so sorry! They 
threatened the lives of my family...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't blame you.
I'll handle this.[A]
Hurry home to your family now.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]I'm sorry...
Truly.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]Surrender peacefully and Father Orlo
may have mercy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I've always been a stubborn wench.
I have no intention of going quietly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You resist?
Then you leave us no choice![A][Clear]
Take her head![A]

[F1]

[OpenMidRight][LoadOrlo]Ha ha ha... I've a
delicious idea... You there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, milord?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell the brigands the
village is in disarray.[A]
Have them collect all the
money and valuables.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, milord.
But...are you certain of this?[A]
If this becomes public--[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You forget that I
speak for the gods.[A]
To accuse me is to oppose
Saint Elimine![A]
I am immune to persecution![A]
Hurry. Before the villagers
realize what's happening.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, milord.[A]

[F2]

[OpenMidRight][LoadScollan]We can ransack
the village?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]Yes.
But in return...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, yeah. Take half the
loot to the castle, right?[A]
That bishop in charge of you guys is
a real piece of work, y'know that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Don't disappoint him.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]All right, kids!
Grab your weapons![A]
Take everything
they got![A]

[F3]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, bandits are approaching
from the mountains in the east.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They aim to attack the
village in the chaos...[A]
We must stop them and help
the villagers![A]

[F4]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is taking so long?![A]
Is the resistance force
so powerful?![A]
[OpenMidRight]It's the Lycian Army![A]
They are supporting the
resistance...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
The Lycian League would
turn against Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually, yes. We've just received
a missive from Juteaux![A]
The Lycian Army is responsible
for the death of Sir Nord.[A]
They are suspected of betraying
Etruria's interests.[A]
They may also have ties with
the bandits.[A]
Lord Arcardo now wants them
dead or alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They killed Sir Nord,
you say...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]It seems they finally have just cause
to get rid of the Lycian Army.[A]
Ties with bandits? The Lycian Army?
Oh, the irony...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo has sent reinforcements
to help capture the Lycian Army.[A]
They should arrive shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He says "capture", but I'm sure he
he intends to kill them.[A]
Let us do the job for him.
Eradicate them![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, milord![A]

[F5]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrlo][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight]Father Orlo, the reinforcements
will arrive shortly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I certainly hope it
will be enough.[A]
They are putting up a better
fight than I expected...[A]

[F6]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Larum?
You're all right?[A]
That puts my mind at ease...[A]
I don't know what I'd say to Elffin
if something happened to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry... If I hadn't been caught
I could have warned you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's fine.
Don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It wasn't your fault.
Cheer up.[A]
And besides, I'm still in one
piece, so there's that, eh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tell me, what is this
army you're with?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy and the Lycian Army![A]
They came here to defeat
the bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia, huh?[A]
They've come a long
way to get here...[A]
Does it look like they'll
help our cause?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes!
They saved me, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]From the sound of it, I've no
reason NOT to join them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
That's great![A]
I'm sure Roy will be
happy too.[A]

[F7]

[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]There are rumors...that Roartz and
Arcardo are working with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?!
Then Lycia is in danger![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]L-Lord Roy![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Your country may be in peril.[A]
Are you free to waste your time
on the Isles as you are?[A]
[OpenFarRight]He's right![A]
Bern wanted us out of Lycia so
they could launch an invasion![A]
We must head back at once![A]
[OpenRight]...We stay here.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?!
Why?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]It's difficult to judge what may
be hearsay and what may be truth.[A]
We can't simply jump on this
rumor and run back to Lycia.[A]
I am certainly concerned, but my father
and General Cecilia are there.[A]
The people on the Isles have only
us to rely on.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That may be, but...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]If we leave without finishing our mission,
then all we've done here was for naught.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...Your army is blessed with
a levelheaded leader.[A]
[OpenRight]What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Lord Roy, I am sorry for
testing you so.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Testing us?
So that was a lie?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]It was the truth.[A]
However, I presented the rumor in a
way that you might take rash action.[A]
Your leader is a prudent individual.
I would join you if you allow it.[A]
[OpenRight]...I don't like that
you tested us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you can help,
I welcome you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now, back to the concern we face here.[A]
What can we do to help the
people of the Isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We must go to the
capital. To Juteaux.[A]
The people will only be liberated
if the corruption is overthrown.[A]
[OpenRight]Then it's settled!
We head for Juteaux![A]
We fight for the people!
We will defeat the true enemy![A]

[F8]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager39]
Oh! You're the resistance
force, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? No?[A][Clear]
Ahhh, that explains it...[A]
This is quite a situation
you're in, though...[A]
Here, take this.
We believe in you.[A]

[F9]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager46]
[ToggleSmile]I'm supposed to give
this staff to Orlo...[A]
He buys things like this with
the money he takes from us.[A]
But I'll give it to
you instead![A]
Please end his rule...
We're counting on you.[A]

[FA]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager48]
My job is to take the village's
tribute to the castle.[A]
If we don't, the village
will be burnt down.[A]
I'll give the money
to you guys instead![A]
I'm tired of being stepped
on by this oppressive lord.[A]
I can tell you're different.[A]

[FB]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
[OpenMidRight]I have staves for sale
if you want any![A]
Wait a second.
Have I met you before...?[A]
Ah, probably just my
imagination...[A]
Anyway, how many staves
do you want?[A]
[ToggleSmile]They work really well. They cure
conditions instead of health.[A][Clear]
You don't want any?! Darn![A]
I'll give you a sample,
so buy one next time![A]

[FC]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49][OpenMidRight]Take this!
I want to help in any way I can.[A]
It's a speedwing![A]
[OpenMidRight]Use it and you'll
become a little faster![A]

[FD]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager45]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's so difficult
under Orlo's rule...[A]
He takes everything from us,
even our hopes and dreams...[A]
Please, take this.
I hope it helps.[A]

[FE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager40]
[OpenMidRight]Good luck to you!
We can't even touch these guys.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Some people in your army
can use bows, can't they?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This should be helpful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know it's not much...
but I want you to have it.[A]

[FF]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager42]
[ToggleSmile]This dusty old lance?[A]
I'll give it to you to use against
the villains here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My foolish brother wielded this
before he died.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He was a terrible fighter, but he
believed his cause was just.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's what got him killed...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He was so very foolish...[A]

[0100]

[LoadOrlo][ToggleSmile]Opposing me...is the equivalent
of opposing the gods![A][Clear]
I shall rain divine punishment
upon you![A]

[0101]

[LoadOrlo][ToggleSmile]You...heathens...
...I represent the gods...[A]

[0102]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, there is a young man claiming
to be with the resistance here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll see him.
Let him pass.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I am pleased to meet you.
My name is Elffin.[A]
I am a member of the
resistance force.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy of the
Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You have my thanks for
saving our village here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We simply did what
we believe is right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]But now you stand
against Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so, I have
no regrets.[A]
We may have opposed Etruria's
immediate interests,[A]
but once the truth about the Isles is
out, I'm certain they will understand.[A]
I sent a letter to a trustworthy
Etrurian noble.[A]
If she takes appropriate measures,
they will send us aid.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I would not
be so sure...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why is that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't you find it odd that Etruria
requested your help here at all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...yes, I do.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]If I may be so bold as to guess...[A]
Was it High Chancellor Roartz and
Lord Arcardo who requested your help?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...It was.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]There may have been ulterior motives for
sending your army away.[A]
Perhaps your presence in Lycia was
undesirable to them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never even
considered that...[A]

[0103]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager39][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you General Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You saved our village.
We owe you our livelihoods.[A]
Please, take this as a token
of our gratitude.[A]
