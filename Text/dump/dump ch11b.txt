[096C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager43][ToggleSmile]Hurry!
This way![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager45]A-are you sure about this?
If we get caught we're--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be stupid![A]
If we stay, we'll be
worked to death![A]
You're just going to lie
down and take that?[A]
Don't you have a family
or something back home?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
[OpenMidRight]There are people coming to
help us from the northeast.[A]
We just have to make it
there in one piece![A]
[096D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]More people escaped?![A]
[MoveMidRight]Where were the guards?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRoberts]They were unconscious.
Someone drugged their food...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Then there must be a
traitor among us.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Morgan![OpenLeft][LoadMorgan][A]
[OpenMidRight]Pursue and eliminate
the escaped workers.[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes, Lord Arcardo.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I will return to Juteaux.
Don't let them escape.[A]
Send more hands to the mines as well.
I can't afford to lose more workers![A]
[096E]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]What?!
Then Lycia is in danger![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]L-Lord Roy![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Your country may be in peril.[A]
Are you free to waste your time
on the Isles as you are?[A][OpenFarRight]He's right![A]
Bern wanted us out of Lycia so
they could launch an invasion![A]
We must head back at once![A]
[OpenRight]...We stay here.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?!
Why?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]It's difficult to judge what may
be hearsay and what may be truth.[A]
We can't simply jump on this
rumor and run back to Lycia.[A]
I am certainly concerned, but my father
and General Cecilia are there.[A]
The people on the Isles have only
us to rely on.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]That may be, but...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]If we leave without finishing our mission,
then all we've done here was for naught.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...Your army is blessed with
a levelheaded leader.[A]
[OpenRight]What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Lord Roy, I am sorry for
testing you so.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Testing us?
So that was a lie?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]It was the truth.[A]
However, I presented the rumor in a
way that you might take rash action.[A]
Your leader is a prudent individual.
I would join you if you allow it.[A]
[OpenRight]...I don't like that
you tested us.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you can help,
I welcome you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now, back to the concern we face here.[A]
What can we do to help the
people of the Isles?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You should head south...
towards Caldonia.[A]
[OpenRight]Why?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Castle Eidyna is located there.[A]
It is where workers are kept before
they are sent to Eburacum.[A]
[OpenRight]Then we must save
the people there![A][......]
[OpenFarLeft]Lord Roy,
please take this sword.[A]
[OpenRight]What is this?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]It is called a wyrmslayer.[A]
It was created during the
Scouring to use against dragons.[A]
It is effective against
wyverns as well.[A]
[OpenRight]Wyrmslayer?
Is this a legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]No. Legendary weapons can only be used by
those whose skill rivals the Eight Legends.[A]
This weapon, however, can be wielded by
anyone with experience in swordplay.[A]
[096F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin, is that castle to
the southwest our target?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is Castle Eidyna.[A]
The people kidnapped on the Isles
are first sent there.[A]
They are then taken to Eburacum
and forced to work in the mines.[A]
As it happens, today is the weekly
shipment of captives to the mines.[A]
It will be difficult to rescue
them once they've been sent off.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then you're saying we have
to rescue them now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I already had some spies infiltrate the
castle and help the people escape.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What will the captives
do once they're out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I told them to send the
captives to the northeast.[A]
In other words, our
present location.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must rescue those people
before sieging the castle.[A]
[0970]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager45][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're imprisoned in
that castle, you say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we've no time to lose. Let's begin
this daring prison break, shall we?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry to ask for
your help like this.[A]
I know you're looking
for your daughter...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be absurd! Consider it
payment for your hospitality.[A]
I won't let some blood-sucking
lord take advantage of his people![A][Clear]
I'm Bartre the Brave, and I'll
smash these puny insects![A]
[E2]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you with
Etruria?![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Y-yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]We fight for the people
suffering under your tyranny![A]
En garde![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]W-wait!
We're on your side![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You aren't with
the castle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're trying to capture
it, actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh!
Sorry then.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Roy, leader of
the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia?
You've come a long way...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We were sent by Etruria to rid
the Isles of the bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's that?!
So you are with Etruria![A]
[OpenMidRight]Please calm yourself!
We share the same goal.[A]
We want to bring peace
to the Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You may end up against
Etrurian nobility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Our mission is to find and
eliminate wrongdoers on the Isles.[A]
Social status matters not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]You, my friend, are
a man of conviction![A]
Very well! I think I'll
join your little army![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You'll help us?
Thank you![A]

[E3]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadFir]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Father?
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Fir!
I've been looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Father,
I've already made up my mind.[A]
I want to become a great master
of the sword like Mother...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is good.
I don't intend to drag you home.[A]
In fact, I want to help you
in your journey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Help me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know well the hardships one faces
in a journey of self-improvement.[A]
I can help you out of a bind if
things get rough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Father, if you keep helping me,
my training is meaningless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Nonsense.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]With your old man around, we can
practice sparring any time![A]
Do you refuse your
father's love?![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]No! It's nothing
like that, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's settled then.[A]
But first we capture
the castle.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]I guess I should tell Roy that
we have another member...[A]
[0971]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMorgan][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Morgan,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
Deploy them immediately.[A]
Spread them around the castle
to defend us on all sides.[A]
[0972]

[0975]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager47]
Are you the guys
helping us out?[A]
Then please, take this.[A]
I grabbed it as I escaped
from the castle.[A]
I hope everyone else
made it out...[A]
[0976]
[LoadMorgan]
[ToggleSmile]What are you doing?![A]
Hurry and kill the ones
who escaped![A][Clear]
Wait, you're not one of
my men... Wh-who are you?![A]
[0977]
[LoadMorgan]
[ToggleSmile]The resistance force has
been eliminated in this area...[A][Clear]
Who...are you people...?[A]
[0978]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This wound is great...
But still, I must not...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You should stay off the battlefield.
Leave the fighting to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are right...
Forgive my being a hindrance...[A]
[0979]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Even though we've saved the
people at Castle Eidyna,[A]
there are others still
suffering in the mines.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is correct.[A]
To liberate the Western Isles,
we must take the capital.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then our next destination
is Juteaux.[A]
...Elffin, may I ask
you something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pardon me if I am
mistaken,[A]
but are you of high
Etrurian nobility?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!![A][Clear]
...What makes you think that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can't quite explain
it, but...[A]
The way you talk sounds
very educated.[A]
In Ostia, I learned how to study
others and size them up.[A]
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What would you do
if you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh. Nothing
in particular.[A]
I'm sure you have a good reason
to hide your identity.[A]
You can tell me when you
feel the time is right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Let's head for Juteaux![A]
To save the Isles and defeat
the true enemy of the people![A]

[OpenLeft]Hey, you with the mustache![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?!
Who are you?[A]
[OpenLeft]Here, give this

Thanks to him, we can see
our families again.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We of the Western Isles always
pay our debts of gratitude![A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]Tell him thanks.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]We're all grateful from the
bottom of our hearts![A]
