[OpenMidLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]S-S...
Sir Flaer![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo.
Why do you fret so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's the Lycian Army!
They come for my blood![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yes, they have been a thorn
in Bern's side for some time...[A]
We knew it would be difficult if they
became too close with Etruria.[A]
That's why we had you send them here.
Ending them should have been simple.[A]
It seems, however, they fight
even better than expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You don't understand the gravity
of this situation![A]
Do you realize how much I've
lost thanks to their meddling?[A]
All the riches I've reaped
from these islands are gone![A]
...And on top of that,
now they want my life![A]
Once they arrive, my legacy
is finished![A]
My hands are shaking.
I don't know what to do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My, how you worry.[A]
I suggest you flee to the mainland.
To Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You will allow it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Warfare is Bern's strong suit.[A]
We also have our secret
weapon ready to brandish.[A]
With it we shall erase the
Lycian Army once and for all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo.[A]
Once Bern and Etruria join forces,
we will have no reason to fear anyone.[A]
Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]No... No!
You're right.[A]
I leave them to you.[A][ClearFace]

[0105]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer][ToggleSmile]Hmph, cowardly Etrurian nobles.[A]
If we defeat the Lycian Army here,
the Isles shall be ours...[A]

[0106]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...[A]
Once we take it,
we can finally go home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]Lord Roy,[A]
I have heard some troubling rumors
from the people living around here.[A]
They say an "unhuman"
resides in the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They say there is a man who
changes form...into a dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]A man?
Who turns into a dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can say nothing more at this point,
but we must proceed with caution.[A]

[0107]

[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the capital...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Once we take it,
we can finally go home.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadElffin][ToggleSmile]I have already sent someone
in to unlock the gate...[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadLarum]
[OpenFarRight]Oh, there she is.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The one over there
dressed like a dancer?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Yes, that's her.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Highness!
[MoveFarLeft]Over[MoveFarLeft] here![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Your Highness?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]...I know not of
what she speaks.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Highness!
You're late.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Larum, why do you call
me "Your Highness"?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]Huh? ...Oh!
Ah...er...[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you know, you look like
royalty, so it's your nickname![A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
My apologies, Lord Roy.[A]
This is Larum, a member
of the resistance.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're Roy?[A]
Everyone on the Isles
has heard of you![A]
They all call you the
Savior from the East.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Nice to meet you!
I'm Larum.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Please leave a little distance![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, your face is all red.
How cute!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]...Larum...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Oh! R-right...
There's something I should tell you.[A]
I've been hearing strange rumors.[A]
The people here say that an
"unhuman" resides in this castle.[A]
[OpenRight]An "unhuman"...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes.[A]
They say he changes form into
something that looks like a dragon![A]
[OpenRight]A human?
That can change into a dragon?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know...
but that's what I hear.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]We must proceed
with caution.[A][SendToBack]

[0108]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEin][OpenMidRight][LoadFlaer]Ah, there
you are, Ein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You called...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will make a report about the
Lycian Army to General Narcian.[A]
I want you to defend the castle
while I am away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Hm?
Who's there?![A][Clear][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Just the wind...?[A][.....][Clear]
Ahem. I will take my leave now.
I leave them to your discretion.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Understood.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ha ha... The Lycian Army will hardly be
able to stand against this dragon.[A]
Normal weapons won't even scratch
its skin.[A]
These manaketes...
They certainly are terrifying beasts.[A]

[0109]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh]...So that's what
the "unhuman" is.[A]
Bern really has brought
dragons into this world.[A]
...What to do now...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I'll pose as a soldier
and observe the dragon's power.[A]

[010A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]La la la la la,[.....]
la la la la la...[A]
All the way out here
in the Isles West,[A]
folks work to death for
nobles in their nest![A][Clear]
This castle's sure to be
brimming with treasure![A]
All this loot was stolen
anyway.[A]
Might as well take it off
these nobles' hands.[A]

[010B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEin][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]The reinforcements from the
south will arrive shortly![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...Th-that's all, sir.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight]That guy gives
me chills...[A]

[010C]

[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]Did you handle the cave on
the outskirts of town?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier6]Yes, sir.[A]
The bandits have blocked
off all entrance to it.[A]
No one will be able to get to
the legendary weapon now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent![A]
Now all we have to do is
clean up the Lycian Army.[A]

[010D]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Raigh? Raigh!
It's so good to see you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you're OK.
We were all worried about you.[A]
I know you wanted to train your magic
skills, but you left so suddenly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I couldn't have learned magic if
I'd stayed in that orphanage.[A]
It was a miracle I picked
up as much as I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Raigh...
The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What?
What happened?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bern came...and
burned it down.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What happened to everybody?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Poppa was killed
trying to protect us...[A]
The young children are under the
care of the St. Elimine Church now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.
It's for the best...[A]
They'll be happier at the church
than at that dilapidated orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't have to be
so callous about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Raigh!
Come with us.[A]
We'll defeat Bern, and then we
can go back to the children![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry,
not interested.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then again...the Lycian Army
might be good company.[A]
They're sure to come across
more dragons at some point.[A]
All right, you got me.
I suppose I'll go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Raigh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I just want you to
know one thing.[A]
I'm not joining to avenge
Poppa or the orphanage![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know, Raigh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then stop looking
at me like that![A]

[010E]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Raigh!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly, Chad.
What happened to the orphanage?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...I knew you'd be concerned.[A]
You ran off, but I knew
you'd never forget us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I was never concerned.
I was just curious.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Bern's troops burned it to the
ground when they invaded Lycia.[A]
Poppa... He couldn't...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?!
They killed Poppa...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge him.[A]
We're stuck on these Isles now.[A]
But I know we'll go back and fight
Bern full force some day...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose there's no point in
telling you, though, is there?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'll go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What?!
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern has a deep connection
with the dragons.[A]
I want to learn more.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...So that's it.
Fine.[A]
Just don't get
in my way.[A]

[010F]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Raigh? Raigh!
It's so good to see you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh...!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you're OK.
We were all worried about you.[A]
I know you wanted to train your magic
skills, but you left so suddenly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I couldn't have learned magic if
I'd stayed in that orphanage.[A]
It was a miracle I picked
up as much as I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Raigh...
The orphanage is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know. I heard from Chad
just a moment ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. In fact, I've joined up
with this army you're in.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just want you to
know one thing.[A]
I'm not here to avenge
Poppa or the orphanage![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know, Raigh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then stop looking
at me like that![A]

[0110]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Raigh!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My thoughts exactly, Chad.[A][Clear]
I heard from Lugh about
the orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...And what did you
think about that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Nothing in particular.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...So you say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've joined up with
your army, by the way.[A]
I want to learn more
about these dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Of course you do. Fine.[A]
But I'm here to avenge Poppa.
Just don't get in my way.[A]

[0111]

[LoadEin][ToggleSmile]...Burn.[A]

[0112]

[LoadEin][ToggleSmile]...What...?![A]

[0113]

[OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]That was not an easy battle...[A]
The dragons' power is truly...
horrific.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]An unhuman...
Now I understand.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How many of these dragons
does Bern have...?[A]
How can we expect to be victorious
against monsters like these?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy!
Keep a level head.[A]
[OpenRight]Ah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I understand your worries.[A]
But if you panic, that feeling
will spread to the army.[A]
You must remember that.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a perfectly understandable
reaction after a fight like that.[A]
But...we also gained knowledge
we did not have before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What knowledge
is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you remember?[A]
I told you Arcardo was rumored
to be working with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that's right![A]
If Bern's dragons are in
an Etrurian castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Arcardo has indeed made
a deal with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...That means Lycia is in danger...[A]
We must return to the mainland.[A]
We have to contact General
Cecilia and conceive a plan...[A]

[0114]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, before returning to the mainland,
there is a matter to take care of.[A]
[OpenMidRight]More bandits?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, thankfully.[A]
A legendary weapon is hidden
in a cave not far from here.[A]
If we obtain it, we can fight
the dragons more effectively.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A legendary weapon... You're right![A]
If we can get all eight of them, we
might have a chance of defeating Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... We must find as
many as we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's go to the
cave and get it![A]

[0115]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]R-report!
I have a message from Etruria...[A]
A revolution has broken out in
Aquileia, capital of Etruria.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]What?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ones leading the revolution are
High Chancellor Roartz and Lord Arcardo.[A]
They have captured King Mordred.[A]
They also say they plan to divide dominion
of the continent between Bern and Etruria![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]The two strongest nations
in Elibe joining forces...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Is General Cecilia all right?!
And what of Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We don't have any
current information...[A]
But the three Etrurian Generals have
parted ways and are working separately.[A]
Mage General Cecilia has fled Aquileia for
the Missur Peninsula in the southwest.[A]
[OpenRight]And the other Generals?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]They're with the revolutionaries against their
will because the king was taken hostage.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Lord Roy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We need to contact
General Cecilia...[A][Clear]
Princess Guinivere...
Please be safe...[A]
