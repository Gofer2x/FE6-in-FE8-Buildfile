[OpenMidRight][LoadGuerrero][ToggleSmile]This is the end of the caaave?[A]
Treasuuure...
Where are yooouu...?[A]
Answer meee...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid]
Boss... Are you sure
about this?[A]
The men from Bern just told
us to block the entrance.[A]
If they catch us now, they'll
surely have us back in chains![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You foooool![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]We'll do as we're told in tiiime...[A]
They'll never know that we took
the treasuuure...[A]
If we block the entrance without taking
the treasure, it's all the same anywaaay...[A]
Do you really want that poor treasure
trapped in here for all eternityyy?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Well, when you put it that way...
I guess you're right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan]Boss![A]
There's an army stationed
outside the cave![A]
[OpenRight]Whaaat?[A]
They want to take our
treasure, do theeey?[A]
Have the boys near the entrance
take them ooouut...[A]
And grab all the treasure cheeests...
We rightfully stole them fiiirst![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]A legendary weapon lies in this cave...?[A]
It's so dark in here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]According to the scholar in
Juteaux I spoke to,[A]
the legendary weapon in this cave is
most likely the Thunder Axe, Armads.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Armads...[A]
An axe this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Armads was wielded by Durban the Berserker,
who was said to be a colossus of a man.[A]
A single blow from his axe surely made
short work of any opponent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Elffin, you seem to know a lot about
the Eight Legends and their weapons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a bard. It is my job
to know myths and legends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'd like to hear some of them
when we have the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
...Lord Roy, it seems we are
not alone in this cave.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We aren't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There are also noxious fumes
coming from the cave walls.[A]
We must tread lightly.[A]
[0BDB]
[LoadGuerrero]Daaaahhhhhh![A][Clear]
Rah![A]
[0BDC]
[LoadGuerrero]Dah...[A]
[0BDD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Where is the legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[A]
I hear wind blowing from
behind the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
I can't hear it...[A]
[MoveRight]A niche...between the
floor and the wall.[A][Clear]
Oh! It opened![A][Clear]
...So this is the legendary weapon?
This axe is enormous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Armads...[A]
The very axe wielded by
Durban the Berserker.[A]
It certainly appears fit for
a warrior of his stature.[A]
[0BDE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, here it is![A]
There's a large axe behind the
throne![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]This is Armads...
Durban's axe...[A]
