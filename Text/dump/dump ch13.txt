[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You haven't taken
the castle yet?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The loyalists led by General
Cecilia fight harder than anticipated...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Cecilia...!
That woman![A]
She interferes in my
work yet again![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][OpenLeft][LoadZephiel]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You seem to be having trouble,
Narcian.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][SendToBack][LoadIdunnHood][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Y-Your Majesty?!
When...did you arrive?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just this moment.[A]
The general from Etruria
fights well, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, Your Majesty...[A]
But everything will soon
be under our control.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Allow me.
I will squash her myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][FastPrint]Your Highness, there
is no need...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]These arms could use some exercise.
It's no bother.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Bring me to her,
Narcian.[A]
[0118]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What's the latest?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The castle has yet
to fall, Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good!
We still have time.[A]
[0119]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenLeft][LoadZephiel]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]So you are Cecilia,
Mage General of Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You fight well. I reward you
with the honor of dueling me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[011A]
[LoadCecilia][ToggleSmile]You're too...
powerful...[......][A]
[011B]
[OpenLeft][LoadZephiel][ToggleSmile]She lost consciousness...
How disappointing. I expected more.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNarcian][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty!
Untouchable as always![A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I suppose it was foolish to expect
a challenge from an Etrurian.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]If you would allow it, Your Majesty,
will you leave her to me?[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]She has caused me...
certain difficulties.[A]
I want to see that she
suffers for them.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hmph. Very well.
Do as you wish.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Your Majesty.[A][Clear]
You! Ready a cell in the dungeon![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, General Narcian.[A]
[011C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][ToggleSmile]Bern has attacked
the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...This wasn't in the agreement.[A]
They promised to leave Etrurian
matters to us of Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What shall we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was it General Narcian who made
the order to attack the castle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, sir.
It was King Zephiel himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really![....]
The king himself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Then Bern never saw us as
partners to begin with.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight]We will observe for now
and fall back in time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[011D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]The castle has fallen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
We were too late.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is General Cecilia
all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's no report of her
death, but it looks grim...[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's still a possibility
that she's alive.[A]
We can't give up on her.
We must hurry![A]
[011E]
[OpenRight][LoadZephiel][OpenFarLeft][LoadNarcian]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty!
We have found Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Bring her before me.[A]
[011F]
[OpenRight][LoadZephiel][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleSmile]My brother...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Guinivere.
So good to see you.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Zephiel, why?[A]
Why do you continue this war?
So many innocent people have died...[A]
[OpenRight]Innocent, you say?[A]
Pah. Jealousy, vanity, greed...[A]
Men kill because of these petty
emotions all across the realm.[A]
How can you say they
are innocent?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I...[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]The world must be liberated from
these trivial creations of man.[A]
That is the purpose of this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...so many people are being
killed in the process.[A]
[OpenRight]A few worthless lives are a fair
trade for the change I desire.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Zephiel...![A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Guinivere, you are my only sister.
My only surviving blood relative.[A]
As such, I forgive you this time,
but I shan't the next.[A]
You would do well to
remember that.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narcian![A]
Is the head of Guinivere's
guard present?[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadNarcian]Yes, Your Majesty.
Melady is here.[A]
[OpenRight]Good.[A]
Have her take Guinivere back to Bern.[A]
Also have her ensure the Fire Emblem
is returned to the Shrine of Seals.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Of course, Your Majesty.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]Zephiel...[A]
[0120]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Melady...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Your Highness, I am pleased
to see you safe. [A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Now, let us return
to Bern...[A]
[NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Your Highness?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Melady![A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]W-what are you doing?![A]
Put that sword down before
you hurt yourself![A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Let me free,
Melady![A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]What?![A]
[CloseSpeechFast]...And what will Your Highness
do if she is freed?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I understand that Roy and the
Lycian Army are nearby...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]You would join the enemy?![A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]I cannot sit idly by and watch as the
world is overrun by Bern's forces...[A]
No matter the reason, it is
senselessly violent conquest.[A]
What kind of future will this war
lead us to...?[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Melady,
I ask you to let me go.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]...There is just...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There is just one thing I
wish to ask, Your Highness.[A]
When you left Bern, why did you
not ask my opinion...?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]I thought involving you would
damage your reputation.[A]
I didn't want you to be branded
a traitor like me.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Does Your Highness honestly think
I would ever pay any heed to that?[A]
I serve Your Highness before I
serve Bern.[A]
It has been so since I was
knighted.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Melady...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
If you tell me to let you go,
then with pleasure, I will.[A]
I ask only one favor of you.[A]
Allow me to accompany you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]Melady...
Thank you...[A]
[0121]
[OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMelady][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Please lower your weapons!
I am not an enemy![A]
[OpenRight]What?
Soldiers, let her through![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy,
it may be a trick...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]She may be a messenger.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMelady][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Are you General Roy?[A]
[OpenRight]...Yes.
And you are?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][NormalPrint]Roy![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Princess Guinivere?![A]
[ToggleSmile]You're unharmed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... I escaped
with her assistance.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMelady]My name is Melady.
It is a pleasure to meet you.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][CloseSpeechFast]Roy,
General Cecilia is alive.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]R-really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, truly.[A]
She is gravely wounded,
but she is alive.[A]
She is locked in a cell
in the castle.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Thank you!
We have to rescue her![A]
[0122]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][OpenRight][LoadZephiel]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are they ready?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, the dragons are prepared
to fight at your command.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Narcian.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian]
[OpenRight]I will give you some dragons
to fortify your legion.[A]
I want you to go with your troops
to Nabata after cleaning up here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nabata?[A]
The desert lands to
the east of here?[A]
[OpenRight]Correct. There is tell of a
hidden village in the desert.[A]
Dragons have supposedly been
living there since the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, now I understand... A legendary
weapon is likely hidden there.[A]
[OpenRight]Precisely.
It must not fall into enemy hands.[A]
I sent some men in already,
but they seem to be outnumbered.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Leave it to me, Your Majesty.
The village shall be ours.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]...I trust that it will.
Do not disappoint me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]You can rest easy,
Your Majesty![A]
By my honor as Wyvern General,
I will not fail you![A]
[0123]
[OpenFarRight][LoadCecilia]
[FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Oh...
Where am I...?[MoveFarRight][A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSophia]You're not well yet...
You mustn't move...[A]
[OpenFarRight]Did you treat my wounds?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes... I'm not an
expert, however...[A]
My work may leave something
to be desired...[A]
[OpenFarRight]No, it's fine.
Thank you.[A]
We must find a way
out of here...[A]
...Ow...![A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Don't move...
Your wound will open...[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]But I must do something...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Everything will
be fine...[A]
I see a light...
It will arrive shortly...[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]A light?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...
A light that will aid us...[A]
We must wait patiently...[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Who are you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I am Sophia...
A shaman of Arcadia...[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]What is Arcadia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I will tell you more later...
For now, please just trust me...[A]
[0124]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlaer][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Narcian!
It's them![A]
The Lycian Army![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?!
Flaer, you cad![A]
I thought you took care
of them at Juteaux![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did![A]
Well...I left a dragon to
deal with them...[A]
I never thought they
would survive![A]
[OpenMidRight]Disregarding your failure,
my reputation is at stake![A]
They defeated a dragon, so they
must be more hardy than I expected.[A]
Yet if I can't defeat them here,
people will doubt my ability...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Narcian...
What should we do...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There is only one thing we CAN do...
Flaer.[A]
I will return to Aquileia and
prepare to face the Lycian Army.[A]
You stay here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
M-me...?
Stay here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't worry.
I don't expect you to defeat them.[A]
All I want is for you to hit them as
hard as you can and soften them up a bit.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]General Narcian!
You intend to use me as fodder?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Flaer...[A]
In truth, your failure in the Western Isles
is grounds for execution.[A]
I am giving you one last chance to prove
that you aren't a complete failure.[A]
You should be thanking me, if anything.[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]I can personally execute
you now if you prefer.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Yes...sir...
I understand.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Good.
Then I bid you adieu.[A][ClearFace]
[0125]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]Yes,
General Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We're leaving.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's actions are an
insult to Etruria.[A]
I cannot aid Bern any further.
We must return to Aquileia.[A]
I will inform General Douglas of this
and plan a new course of action.[A]
Fall back at once![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]
[0126]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager10]
Here, take this ring.[A]
It will build up your
muscles when you use it.[A]
...It might make the ladies a
little less attractive, though.[A]
[0127]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]
I thought I'd try to defend
myself with this sword,[A]
but I don't know how to use it.[A]
It's a nice sword though,
isn't it?[A]
The last one to use it was a kid
named Al.[A]
He was a courageous one, and he
stood up to Bern, just like you.[A]
Here. I'll give it to you.
Use it to end this war![A]

Cecilia, Perceval, and Douglas!
They're the three Etrurian Generals.[A]
Even the three Wyvern Generals
of Bern are no match for them.[A]
...That's what I'd like
to think, anyway.[A]
[012F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]
[ToggleSmile]General Cecilia...
She was defeated in one blow...[A]
King Zephiel is more powerful than
any of us could have imagined...[A]
[0130]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
General Perceval still swears loyalty to
Prince Myrddin even after his passing.[A]
Loyal and hard-working to the end.
That's what I call a real man...[A]
[0131]
[LoadFlaer]You've made it...[A][Clear]
But I am a knight of Bern!
I will not surrender![A]
[0132]
[LoadFlaer]I may fall, but Bern
cannot be stopped...[A]
Your defeat is
inevitable...[A]
Be sure of it...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I failed.
I'm so ashamed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The important thing is
that you are alive...[A]
But how are your wounds?
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadSophia][OpenLeft][LoadCecilia]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.
This girl treated them for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who is she?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]I am Sophia...
A shaman of Arcadia...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]She foresaw your coming.[A]
She also said she would explain
her story once we had time.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yes, now is fine...[A]
Arcadia, my home, lies to the east
in the Nabata desert...[A]
We have always kept hidden...but Bern
discovered our existence...and...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]They attacked?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
I...was too slow to act,
so I was captured...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why would Bern attack a
small village like yours?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I do not know...[A]
Perhaps they learned of the
dragons that live in Arcadia...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Dragons?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]That's right...[A]
Arcadia was founded by both
dragon and man ages ago...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]...I never knew such a
place existed...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Lord Roy...
Please, save our village...[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Her story seems too
fantastic to be true.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]
Dragons or no, I believe her when she
says Bern attacked her village.[A]
Sophia, we are in your debt for
saving General Cecilia.[A]
We owe it to you to do what we
can to save your village.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...Thank you...[A]
[OpenRight]Can you tell me more
about this Arcadia?[A]
And the dragons?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...Yes... I will gladly tell
you all that I know...[A]
[0134]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier7][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Perceval, we will station
ourselves at this castle.[A]
We shall prepare for further attacks
from the revolutionaries.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, please do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We found this in the castle.
Please take it.[A][Clear]
General Perceval, please...

[OpenMidRight]I will.
