[OpenLeft][LoadIgrene][OpenFarRight][LoadFae]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hurry, Fae![A]
Follow this path and
find a place to hide.[A]
Can you make it?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]I'm...
I'm tired![A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Now is no time for
complaints.[A]
Go, or Bern's soldiers
will find us.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]What happened
to Sophia?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't know...[A]
She may have been captured
by Bern's troops.[A]
[OpenFarRight]But if Bern catches us, then
we can see the outside world![A]
[OpenLeft]Fae, no.[A]
The elder strictly forbids
communication with the outside world.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][NormalPrint]Aw...
Please?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No.[A]
...I do wonder how Bern found
out about our village, however...[A]
Perhaps it is related to the ominous
force Sophia detected in the soldiers...[A]
[OpenFarRight]What?[A]
[OpenLeft]Ah, sorry![A]
Now is not the time
for that![A]
Fae! Over here!
Hurry![A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...I want to see the
outside world, too.[A]
[0136]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRandy][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Has General Narcian arrived yet?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He sent some sellswords and dragons,
but the general himself isn't here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What on earth is he thinking?[A]
How does he expect these sparse troops
to tip the odds in our favor...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]King Zephiel must be notified about
the dragons living here.[A]
Zeiss, go to Aquileia and make
a report to His Majesty.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What should I say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Tell him that dragons do indeed inhabit
this village.[A]
A captive tells us there are even divine
dragons, the most powerful of all.[A]
...Go quickly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, sir.[A]
[0137]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is a fierce sandstorm.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes... These sandstorms have always
protected our village from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can imagine that most who wander into
this mess would give up quickly.[A]
I can barely see an arm's length ahead...[A]
In which direction do we move?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Head to the northeast...
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There may be objects covered by the
sand, blown about by the storm...[A]
Please watch your step...[A]
[0138]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMaggie][OpenFarRight][LoadRose]
[ToggleSmile]Maggie, my sweet, did you see that
group heading right into the desert?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, Rose, I most certainly did.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
They must be headed for the hidden
village said to be near here, Maggie.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Bless my soul, Rose.
I believe you may be correct.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]But my sweet Maggie, we wouldn't want to
get lost in the sandstorm, would we?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Of course not, Rose.[A]
Then we wouldn't be able to
find our way home.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]Do you think we should give up
on the village then, Maggie?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, you forget the rumors say
there is great treasure in the village.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]Well, we certainly wouldn't want to
miss out on that, would we, Maggie?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]Of course not, Rose.[A]
It would make us far richer than
ambushing travelers has.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveFarRight]But I don't want to
get lost, Maggie.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]My dear Rose, hear me out.[A]
We need only follow closely behind the
group we saw heading into the desert.[A]
That will ensure they lead us right
to the village.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What a wonderful idea, Maggie.[A]
And once we reach the village, we can
thank them by mashing their heads in.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Marvelous, my dear Rose.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]Let's be off then.
Shall we, Maggie?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Why certainly,
my dear Rose.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Then let's waste no time,
my sweet Maggie.[A]
[0139]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]The sandstorm...
It stopped.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]This is our chance, Lord Roy!
The village is in clear sight now![A]
[OpenMidRight]But it is to the enemy, too.
We must hurry![A]
[013A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadRandy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Randy, we have finished
searching the village.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Did you find the
legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]No...[A]
But we destroyed all the passageways
we suspected might lead to it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good work.[A]
Now all that's left is to
stop the Lycian Army.[A]
[013B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia]
Something...is glittering
in the sand...[.....] Oh...[A][Clear]
What a beautiful ring...[A]
[013C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
Have you heard of the sky god, Delphi?[A]
He is said to race through the skies
and protect all living things.[A]
They say that with his blessing,[A]
wyvern riders and pegasus knights
can fly freely without danger...[A]
[013D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager24]
There are a lot of things
buried in the sand.[A]
If you're really lucky, you might
find something good.[A]
Try looking around the bones.[A]
[013E]
[LoadRose][ToggleSmile]Dear me, Maggie...
This hurts, doesn't it?[A]
[013F]
[LoadMaggie][ToggleSmile]Oh my, Rose...
I've never known such pain.[A]
[0140]
[LoadRandy]
My sword is unmatchable.
Choose your death.[A]
Will you die by the blade...
or by its light?[A]
[0141]
[LoadRandy]
You're so strong...
I'm impressed...[A]
It's an honor to die
by your hand...[A]
[0142]
[OpenFarRight][LoadSophia][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]That was a difficult battle...
but we won.[A]
Sophia, where are
the villagers?[A][Clear]
Sophia, are you OK?
What's wrong?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]...The entrance to the temple...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]This door...?[A]
It looks like it's been
forced open.[A]
What lies inside the temple?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Something we call a
legendary weapon...[A]
It is a spell tome...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]A legendary weapon?!
There's one here, too?![A]
...That must be
what Bern was after![A]
Are we too late?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]It is still here...
I can sense it...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadRoy][FastPrint]All right!
Then let's get it![A][Clear]
We may still be able
to stop Bern![A]
[0143]
[OpenLeft][LoadVillager19][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Who trespasses in this place?
What is your business here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][CloseSpeechFast]My name is Roy.[A]
Sophia brought me here. I came
to protect the village.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Sophia...?[A]
Then it was you who drove
off Bern's soldiers?[A]
Oh dear...
Please forgive me.[A]
I am the elder of Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The elder...
Are you a dragon?[A]
[OpenLeft]A dragon... I have
been called that before.[A]
But that was a time
long past.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Let me think...[A]
Yes, the only real dragon we
have now is Fae right here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFae][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Hi...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]This little girl is a dragon?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yes, though she has
not yet matured.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Elder, do you know anything about
the dragons fighting for Bern?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]What?!
Bern is allied with dragons?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we have seen them.[A]
[OpenLeft]I do not know...[A]
Dragons are not supposed to exist in
this world, except for in this village.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIgrene]Elder,
if I may.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]What is it, Igrene?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia said that she could detect an
evil force emanating from Bern's troops.[A]
It may be related to the dragons Roy
says he has seen with Bern.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Perhaps...[A]
I am too old to detect
such forces now myself.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Sophia can detect an evil force?
What does that mean?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sophia is half dragon and half human.[A]
That gives her the ability to detect
the auras emitted by other dragons.[A]
She says, however, that she detects an
unnaturally twisted force from Bern.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]I think that it should be
investigated further.[A]
Elder, if you will allow it, I would like
to join Roy so that I might learn more.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]I would prefer not to involve
ourselves in outside matters...[A]
But this is certainly a
special case.[A][Clear]
Will you take her, Roy?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I am Igrene,
Guardian of Nabata.[A]
I am confident in my skills
with the bow.[A]
I believe I can aid you
in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I appreciate it.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFae][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I want to go too![A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
Don't be ridiculous. You may not.[A]
There is no telling what may happen if
the world learns of your existence![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadIgrene][CloseSpeechFast][OpenMidRight]If there is nothing else,
let's be off.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yes, let's.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFae]...Fine... I will just follow
them sneakily![A]
