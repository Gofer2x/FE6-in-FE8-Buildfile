[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadOates][ToggleSmile]Haven't you found the
legendary weapon yet?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]We believe it is inside this
altar, but we can't get it open...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Break it open if you have to!
It doesn't matter![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]The enemy has already entered the temple,
so the men are all preparing for battle![A]
We don't have the manpower to break it
open right now![A]
[OpenRight]Blasted distractions...
We don't have time for this.[A]
As soon as the enemy is defeated, locating
the weapon is our highest priority.[A]
[0BE0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is what it looks like
under the desert?[A]
There's so much...water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia]This is close to a source
of groundwater...[A]
This is the reason plants and animals
can live in our village...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So this is the source
of the oasis.[A]
Still, how did you find such
an ideal location?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Athos...[A]
Archsage Athos
led us here...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You mean the Athos of the
Eight Legends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
After the Scouring...Archsage Athos
traveled all across Elibe...[A]
At the end of his journey, he discovered
our village of both man and dragon...[A]
He told us it was only a matter of time
until we were discovered...[A]
[OpenMidRight]So he brought you into the desert
where you could stay hidden...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... He concealed his legendary
weapon within this temple...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Will your village permit us to
use this legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Archsage said that we were to
use his weapon to protect Arcadia...[A]
As long as you use it...to save Elibe
and to protect us...then of course...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It will be invaluable.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Some of the pathways in this temple
will sink into the water without warning...[A]
Please be careful...[A]
[0BE1]
[LoadOates][ToggleSmile]I...wasn't expecting you to
put up such a fight.[A]
[0BE2]
[LoadOates][ToggleSmile]Where...did you learn...
to fight...like this...?[A]
[0BE3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is here...
Inside this altar...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
It won't open...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Only those of the village
may open the altar...[A]
Please allow me...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][.......][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]There...
This is the legendary weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Athos used this?
Then it's...[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes... It is the Infernal Truth.
Forblaze...[A]
[0BE4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The tome appears to be inside
the altar, Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you get it out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I sent some people to ask the
villagers about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, but let's not
force the issue.[A]
If they will not give us permission to
use it, then we leave it here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[A][ClearFace]
[0BE5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
The villagers helped us remove
the tome from the altar![A]
Here it is.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]
...If this is what Archsage Athos used, it
must be Forblaze, the Infernal Truth.[A]
The legends say that none could
escape its fiery punishment.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...We must use it
cautiously then.[A]
