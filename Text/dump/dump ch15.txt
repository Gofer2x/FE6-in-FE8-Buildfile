[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadRaith]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Commander Raith, I have an update on
the girl we captured...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Girl?[A]
The one that was scurrying
around outside the castle?[A]
[MoveRight]I distinctly recall telling
you to throw her out![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]But sir, she was
carrying this.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]Is this...a dragonstone?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...I believe so.[A]
[OpenRight]Do you know what this
is used for?[A]
[OpenLeft]I saw ones like it in the invasion of Lycia.[A]
The manaketes that joined us carried
them when they were in human form.[A]
[OpenRight]...This one does look a tad different from
the other dragonstones I've seen.[A]
Still, the possibility that she is
a dragon cannot be ignored.[A]
We should inform King Zephiel and
await further orders.[A]
Keep the girl inside the castle![A]
[0145]
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Fae has been taken
to that castle?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]That's what the
locals told me.[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIgrene]Roy, I apologize...[A]
This is my fault for not
considering what Fae might do.[A]
We have no time for this rescue.
We must hurry to Aquileia.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]This is nobody's fault.[A]
If Bern gets their hands on her,
it could be catastrophic.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She should be safe as long as she remains
in human form and hides her dragonstone.[A]
[OpenRight]Dragonstone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When dragons are in human form, they
seal their power into dragonstones.[A]
Dragons use vast amounts of energy
to maintain their true shape,[A]
so most remain in human form to
minimize the stress on their bodies.[A]
[OpenRight]That must be what the unhumans
with Bern do as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From what you have told me,
that seems most likely.[A]
Dragons have apparently been taking human
form since the end of the Scouring.[A]
[OpenRight]For that long...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy, the spy we sent
to the castle has returned.[A]
[OpenRight]What did he find out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Many soldiers are coming
out of the castle.[A]
They seem to be fortifying
their defenses.[A]
[OpenRight]They must have discovered
that Fae is a dragon...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The troops on the border
seem to have noticed us.[A]
[OpenRight]Then we must move quickly.[A]
[0146]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perceval,
you don't have to do this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please don't worry about me, Sir Douglas.
You must return to King Mordred.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But attacking the Lycian Army...?
It is pointless.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roartz only wants me out of
the capital.[A]
He's worried I'll stab him in the
back when he isn't looking.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That man, worrying about traitors?[.....]
Hah![A]
Why, he was the first to betray
his loyalty to the king![A]
Truly a snake if I ever met one.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No one's loyalty to Etruria can
compare to yours, Sir Douglas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Rubbish.
Just look at yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...When Prince Myrddin still lived,
I never hesitated to fulfill his will.[A]
I believed I could dedicate my life
to him and the good of Etruria.[A]
My actions now protect the king's life,
and yet...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You hesitate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Frankly, yes.
It feels meaningless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perceval, I want you to listen to me.
Don't respond. Let it sink in.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria...[....]will fall along with the
king before this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No matter what happens,
I will stay by the king's side.[A]
But you, Perceval, are of a different breed.
You must lead the Etruria of tomorrow.[A]
Despite the impending collapse, I firmly
believe Etruria will prosper once more.[A]
Perceval, you must leave Etruria for
now and await your time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Sir Douglas!
What do--[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadSoldier2]General Perceval![A]
The Lycian Army
stands dead ahead![A]
What are your orders, sir?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Go! I will return
to Aquileia.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...Move forth!
Pursue the Lycian Army![A]
[0147]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]This is a
battlefield...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do we do, Boss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The armies are gonna loot the villages.
We better get to 'em first.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]All right, Boss![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Just don't hurt anybody who
isn't askin' for it. Got it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yeah, yeah...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He's too nice for his own good...[A]
If anything happens to the villagers,
we can just say the armies did it.[A]
[0148]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRaith][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft]Commander Raith,
the reinforcements are ready![A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent.
Deploy them now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A]
[0149]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadElffin]
[OpenMidRight]Perceval.
It is good to see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...!![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you forgotten my face?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No... I could never.
But it cannot be...[A]
The prince...is dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I understand your confusion.[A]
A man who was declared dead
stands before your very eyes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin!
It is you...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry to have put you
through such trouble.[A]
...It has already been over a year
since the attempt on my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Attempt on your life?![A]
I thought Your Highness fell
off his horse in an accident.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was hit with
poisoned darts.[A]
One to my horse...
and one to myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Douglas was the first to notice and
made it public that I had died.[A]
A look-alike corpse was placed
in my coffin.[A]
It was all an act to make it appear that
the assassination had been successful.[A]
Douglas entrusted me to his daughter
and had me escape to the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Douglas knew
all this time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even after I escaped west, the poison
had me ill for many months.[A]
I drifted between life and death for so long
that Douglas' daughter nearly lost hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]The resistance force nursed me
back to health.[A]
Ironic, isn't it?[A]
The resistance, enemy of the nobility,
saved the life of the prince of Etruria![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]My recovery...was slow.[A]
I saw the crimes committed by
Etrurian nobles firsthand.[A]
I felt so ashamed that I had never
noticed while I was on the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidRight]As I aided the resistance, I waited for
my chance to return to the mainland.[A]
Then along came Roy,
and I knew it was time.[A]
That is how I ended up here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My prince...[A]
I am thankful beyond words
that you are alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am now with the Lycian Army,
and my identity must remain hidden.[A]
However, if I still have the loyalty
you pledged to me in the past...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Until the day I die,
my prince.[A]
I have only one master, and it
is you, Prince Myrddin.[A]
[014A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Perceval![A]
It is you, isn't it?
I've been looking for you![A]
I am...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]
[ToggleSmile]Wait! Wait!
Stop![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't remember?!
We met before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think I recall seeing you
at Douglas's manor.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes!
That's me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But the girl I met then was
far less...garish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that supposed to mean?
Ah, never mind.[A][ToggleSmile]
My name is Larum.[A]
I'm here on the orders
of Prince Myrddin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin...?
Don't be daft.[A]
The prince passed away in
an accident over a year ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well...
Look at this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That emblem...!!
It belonged to the prince...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now do I have your attention?
Look at this letter, too.[A]
The prince told me to give
it to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
His Highness's handwriting...
He lives![A]
I hesitate no more.[A]
If the prince is in the Lycian Army,
then I am as well.[A]
[ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wha--?
That was quick...[A]
I was hoping things would get
a little more dramatic...[A]
Like, "If you want my skill,
you'll have to best me first!"[A]
Oh well. This works too.[A]
[014B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Why are you attacking
the villages?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Excuse me?
Who d'you think you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I asked you a question.[A]
Tell me why you're
attacking the villages![A]
[OpenMidLeft]"Why?"
I guess it's yer fault, really.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our fault?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep.[A]
You idiots make war, and poor folk like
me resort to raidin' to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We fight to help
people like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D'you know how many
times I've heard that?[A]
This is reality, kid.[A]
You all say yer tryin' to help, but
it's all hot air and empty promises.[A]
If yer gonna say somethin' like
that, then prove it.[A]
You don't even know what's goin' on.
Now get outta my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Listen, I ain't playin' games
with you.[A]
If ya don't get outta here, I'll
do somethin' we'll both regret...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I won't move.
Kill me if you will.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If I let you pass, then I too have
said nothing but hot air.[A]
I tell the truth!
We fight to help the people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Heh heh... You...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I've never met anyone
so naive as you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Do you...
laugh at me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Still, you've moved this old
raider's heart.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Yep. You win.
I'll stop lootin'.[A]
But let me fight with you.[A]
Show me firsthand that yer
true to yer words.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
After being with us for a while,
I'm positive you will understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ya certainly
seem confident at least.[A]
I'm Garrett.
And you are...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina?[A]
It's a pleasure to make yer
acquaintance, milady.[A]
[014C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]General Perceval![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Roy.[A]
I wish to join your cause.
Will you accept me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Absolutely![A]
We're honored to have
someone of your ability.[A]
But why the sudden
change of heart?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Must I answer
that question?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I won't force you if you
have reason not to tell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Forgive me.[A]
I shall tell you
when the time comes.[A]
[014D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[ToggleSmile]A little girl was taken
to the castle...[A]
Here, I'll give you this.
Please rescue her.[A]
Our priest always had
this tome with him.[A]
...He was taken to the castle,
too, but he never returned.[A]
[014E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
This is a Hammerne staff.[A]
It can repair your weapons,
spell tomes, and staves.[A]
Just about the only thing it
can't repair is itself.[A]
It'll wear down every time you
use it, so wield it wisely.[A]
[014F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]
I've been hearing about
bandits in this area.[A]
I bet they're all
savage killers.[A]
They probably have no
conscience at all.[A]
[0150]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
The rumors say that the three Generals
of Etruria have been divided...[A]
But so have the hearts of
the people.[A]
I only hope they don't have to
fight against each other...[A]
[0151]
[LoadRaith][ToggleSmile]What is your purpose here?[A]
I don't know why you would
attack us.[A]
[0152]
[LoadRaith][ToggleSmile]It's that girl,
isn't it...?[A]
She isn't human...
Why...do you seek her...?[A]
To use her power...?
Gah...![A]
[0153]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy!
Here she is![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]You found her?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I believe you owe Lord Roy
a thank you, young lady.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenLeft][LoadFae][FastPrint]...Sniff...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Easy, Merlinus.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...Why did you follow us?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I just wanted to see
the outside world...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]You put yourself in danger
for such a trivial reason?![A]
Do you know how much
trouble you've caused?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]But...but...
[MoveLeft]I'm never, ever allowed outside![A]
The elder says I have to
remain hidden...[A]
I'm always alone...
locked up in my room...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Lord Roy,
what shall we do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...You could have been killed.[A]
Do you understand how much worry
and trouble you've caused?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yes...
I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Truly?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes... Sniff...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All things considered, I think we have
no choice but to take you with us.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]Really?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]The enemy might already know
about her now.[A]
If that's true, she'll be safer with us
than returning unguarded to Arcadia.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Hurray![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Hush! This isn't
cause for celebration.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You mustn't run off
alone anymore.[A]
Do you promise?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Yes!
I pinky swear![A]
