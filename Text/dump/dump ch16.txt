Curses! A thousand curses...!
The Lycian Army still stands![A]
How have they come so far?![A]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier2]G-General Narcian...[A]
Head Wyvern General Murdock
is here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]He is?![A]
Th-then posthaste!
Send an escort![A]
Ensure he receives
every hospitality...[A]
[OpenRight]He is already here...[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMurdock]Yes. Enough.
Step aside.[OpenRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]S-Sir Murdock...
What a pleasant surprise![A]
What brings you all the
way from Ilia?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Enough of your squirrelly
pleasantries, Narcian.[A]
I want an explanation for
this embarrassment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Murdock...[A]
I don't believe I understand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
Then allow me to explain.
Princess Guinivere has escaped yet again.[A]
Flaer, your lieutenant, has failed
in the Western Isles and is dead.[A]
And finally, perhaps most
egregious of all,[A]
you have neglected your mission to
capture the village in Nabata,[A]
despite specific orders directly
from King Zephiel's mouth![A][Clear]
This is inexcusable, Narcian!
Explain yourself![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Oh, th-that...[A]
Well, you see, there have been many
complications, so I took it upon myself to--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hold your tongue.
That's enough.[A]
I've orders from the king.[A]
I am to revoke your title
of Wyvern General.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]You are to be
replaced by Galle.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Sir Murdock!
Please wait![A]
Allow me one more chance!![A]
[OpenMidRight]...The Lycian Army
approaches fast.[A]
Show your worth and
stop them in their tracks.[A]
If you succeed, perhaps the
king will reconsider.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Murdock...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Narcian...[A]
Don't fail the king,[....]
or me,[....] again.[A]
[0157]
[OpenFarRight][LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]Balderdash!
A demotion?![A]
And I'm to be replaced by Galle
of all people...![A]
Never!
I will not allow it![A]
B-but what is left for
me to do...? No...![A]
My status and reputation...
Everything is crumbling down![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][FastPrint]General Narcian,
the enemy draws near...[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]Silence!
I know that already.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Wait.[A]
Melady's younger brother is
stationed in this castle...[A]
And Melady's the one who
helped the princess escape![A]
Ah-ha![A]
I can say he was leaking information
to the enemy! What a flawless plan![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm hm hm hm...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, General Narcian...
What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
Oh. You know Melady's
younger brother, don't you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You mean Sir Zeiss?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]That's him. Zeiss.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I have reason to suspect he's leaking
information to the Lycian Army.[A]
Bring him here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
I can't believe that Sir Zeiss
would ever do such a thing...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, yes, it's shocking! I know!
Now shut your trap![A]
Do as you're told and
bring him before me![A]
[0158]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is Castle Aquileia, Lord Roy.[A]
Our information says that the
revolutionaries are stationed inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thank you for your help,
Father Yoder.[A]
Thanks to the church, we were able
to avoid a battle in the city.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it is I who must
thank you.[A]
The church has been persecuted
by the revolutionaries.[A]
Were it not for you, we would have
been forced out already.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Persecuted?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can only presume it is because of our
investigation into Bern's dragons.[A]
Before she ascended to heaven, our founder,
Saint Elimine, said these words:[A]
"Allow not dragons to return to this realm,
for that would bring suffering to many."[A]
That's why we must do everything we can
to send the dragons back to their world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The revolutionaries are with Bern, so that
explains the persecution of the church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]We have discovered something
interesting as well.[A]
The return of the dragons is tied to the
Fire Emblem, Bern's greatest treasure.[A]
We don't yet know how, so that's why I
sent Saul and Dorothy to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hmm.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy, you must stop
the revolutionaries.[A]
If you would allow me to give
you one more piece of advice,[A][SendToBack]
try talking to some of the troops.[A]
I'm certain many of them were forced
into the army against their will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.
Thank you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saint Elimine's blessings upon you,
Lord Roy.[A]
[0159]
[OpenRight][LoadArcardo][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Th-the enemy is
at our doorstep![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Oh... What can we do?[A]
If we're captured, we will
be tried as traitors![A]

[OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadRoartz][OpenRight][LoadArcardo]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]...Arcardo! This is all your fault![A]
If you had eliminated the Lycian Army at
the Isles as you were supposed to...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]B-but Lord Roartz...!
...No![A]
This is neither the time nor
place to argue, my lord![A]
We must make our
escape quickly![A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]But escape to where...?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]...Let us turn to Bern![A]
This plot originated from
them to begin with...[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, of course![A]
We have proven
ourselves useful.[A]
They're sure to offer us
suitable positions.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][FastPrint]...And what do you intend
to do with the king?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Er... Well, Bern will probably see
that no harm comes to him.[A]
King Zephiel's mother was
Etrurian, after all.[A]
Douglas, I suggest
you flee as well...[A]
[OpenFarRight]And I suggest you shut your mouth.[A]
I only fought alongside you because
King Mordred's life was at stake.[A]
I do not intend to go along with
your scheme to the end.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Hmph! Unbending as always.
Suit yourself.[A]
Arcardo, we escape now![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadArcardo]Lord Roartz!
Wait for me...[A][ClearFace][......]
[015A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadDouglas][ToggleSmile]...Dirty traitors![A]
[ToggleSmile]Fleeing with their tails
between their legs...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can't imagine it took much for
Bern to seduce them.[A]
They'll meet their end at the hands
of the Lycian Army before long...[A][Clear]
When Prince Myrddin returns...
Etruria will be whole again.[A]
But until then...I shall continue
to fight for the king.[A]
My loyalty and honor as Great General
depend upon it![A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadGalle][ToggleSmile]Zeiss.
Where are you?[A]
[015D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGalle][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeiss][CloseSpeechFast]I'm here, Sir Galle.
Is something wrong?[A]
Why did you summon me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Zeiss, you must hide.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you mean?
The enemy is before us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Listen to me.[A]
General Narcian has given the order
for you to be taken prisoner.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
Does he think that
I have betrayed Bern?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He needs a scapegoat for
his failures.[A]
He says that you worked with Melady
to leak information to the enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]With my sister?
I don't even know where she is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Melady has apparently joined the
Lycian Army alongside the princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Melady turned to the enemy?!
I don't believe it for a second...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ask her yourself.
She is apparently here.[A]
Would that I could go with you,[A]
but General Murdock ordered me to
observe the outcome of the battle.[A]
Zeiss, get out while you still can.
Talk to Melady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Sir Galle!
I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I will not make a move until
I hear Melady's story.[A][ClearFace]

Are you kidding me?[A]
What about my money?
I haven't been paid yet![A]
[0160]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
I can hear the riches calling
to me! "Cath! Take us!"[A]
This is the most extravagant
palace in Elibe...[A]
I bet the treasure's nothing to
sneeze at, either.[A]
It was all taken from people like me
anyway, so I'm just reclaiming it![A]
[0161]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, fella![A]
You lead the army that's
attacking the castle, right?[A]
Do you have any need of
an extra mage?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Well, I guess we could
always use more...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You don't say!
Then today is your lucky day.[A]
Here's a mage for hire.
How about it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]You know a mage?
Where is he?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Er, I was talking
about myself, buddy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Hey, don't look at
me like that![A]
I'm no slouch with
a spell tome.[A]
I'm all yours for
10,000 gold![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]10,000?!
That seems pretty steep...[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Come on, you're breakin'
my heart here![A]
I need the money for
my nana...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Is your grandmother sick
or something?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Er... Y-yeah! That's it.
Sick is a good way to describe her...[A]
Anyway, I need the cash.
Come on, pal![A]
[0162]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[FastPrint][ToggleSmile]If your grandmother's sick, then I suppose
it's a worthy cause for the money...[A]

[0164]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]If your grandmother's sick, then I suppose
it's a worthy cause for the money...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You betcha! She's so sick
you don't even know.[A]
She always gets these headaches
on her back...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Huh?
Headaches on her back?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh, y-you know what I mean.[A]
That's just one of her many symptoms,
each worse than the last...[A][Clear]
...OK, all the money seems

[ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, but I can't justify paying
10,000 gold for a single mage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...W-well, I guess I can take
it down to 8,000...[A]

[OpenLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, but...[A]

Uh... Well, I guess
6,000 will do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Er...[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]Please. I really

[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]Come on, I'm begging you!
Please hire me![A]

[OpenLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]
...Please... I swear
I'll be useful...[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]The money isn't mine to spend.[A]
I can't use so much of
it in one place.[A]
[OpenLeft]Argh! I give up! Fine!

[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]I don't want to work for

[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Douglas...[A]
Why is someone of your stature
fighting for the revolutionaries...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]The king's safety takes
priority over all.[A]
There is nothing more to
it than that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]If this continues, Etruria will
become a mere puppet of Bern![A]
The king must have dominion over
this nation for us to serve him.[A]
The path you are on will only
lead to Etruria's destruction![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If the nation is doomed to
collapse, then so be it.[A]
But I will ensure the
king's safety![A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?![A]
Our loyalty is to our people,
to our nation![A]
The Etrurian Army exists for
the people.[A]
The soldiers are not the king's
personal bodyguards![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

please reconsider![A]
You are the Great General, the
highest rank in the Etrurian Army![A]
How can you align yourself with
these traitors...?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Klein.
I am a soldier.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our king's life is at Bern's mercy.[A]
I cannot cast away my loyalty
and turn to the enemy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...There are those who toss away
their honor for riches and power.[A]
I will not do the same. My loyalty
to the king will never falter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]I am an old man, and
my time has come.[A]
The Etrurian Army belongs to
your generation now.[A]
I only ask that you lead it
in a way I would be proud.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...I've been accused of
betraying Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh no...![A]
I feel...I am at
fault for this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Galle said that you
had joined the enemy.[A]
I couldn't believe it, but now
I see it with my own eyes![A]
Why?!
Why did you betray Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never betrayed Bern.
I have always served Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You threw away everything...
Your homeland, your family...[A]
Even your beloved Galle...
for the princess.[A]
For that...obstinate princess
who betrayed her own brother![A]
[OpenMidRight]Enough, Zeiss![A]
I will not tolerate you
insulting Princess Guinivere![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]It is the princess, not the king,
who works for the good of Bern.[A]
At first I was angry and confused
that she did not tell me more.[A]
But now that I am again at
her side, I understand...[A]
She is not mistaken.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...Sir Galle was right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What? Galle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]He said that he wouldn't move
until he heard your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]He did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm not sure yet if I agree with you...
but I know I can trust you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Zeiss!
Does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If the leader of the Lycian Army
will allow it, I want to go with you.[A]
I want to see the princess that

I had no choice but to send you

[OpenMidRight]No, I wanted to.
It's OK.[A]

harsh world I saved you from.[A]
I just wish there had been
another way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You saved me from a terrible life
of poverty...and starvation...[A]
You raised me as one of your

I owe you my life. I'm just glad
I could repay your favor.[A]

Were I to turn to the Lycian Army now,
they would surely take his head.[A]

If the Lycian Army strikes me
down, I will die in peace.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What will you do?[A]

I'm glad to hear it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you going

If I turn to the Lycian Army now,

[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]In southern Bern lies a temple
called the Shrine of Seals.[A]
Within it lies the sword of Hartmut,
founder of Bern.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is it...
a legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Yes. The most powerful of
them all, in fact.[A]
It was made to slay the leader of
the dragons in the Scouring.[A]
Its power was so immense that it had
to be sealed away after the war.[A]
The Fire Emblem is the key to
accessing it once more.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The key...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My brother...is forcing the world
into submission with military might.[A]
I cannot forgive him, no matter
his reasons.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][FastPrint]All we must do to stop him is
defeat the dragons he commands.[A]
[OpenRight]Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]...I will be remembered in infamy,
as a traitor to my nation.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]No...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The people will resent me
for the rest of my days.[A]
Roy, promise me this
one thing.[A]
When we invade Bern, do
not harm any civilians...[A]
[OpenRight]I will not.
I promise you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Thank you.[A]
