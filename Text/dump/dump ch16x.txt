[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadWindham][ToggleSmile]Lord Roartz fled?![A]
What of me?! I betrayed the church and
took control of this tower on his order![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roartz's message said he leaves
us to fend for ourselves.[A]
Because we were unable to bend the church
to his side, he has no more use for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
This is all Yoder's fault. If he hadn't
meddled in my affairs...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I agree...but that's the least
of our worries right now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Very well...
Then this is our last stand.[A]
If we are to die, then the Lycian
Army shall fall along with us![A]
Prepare the Heavenly Arrows![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But sir, we'll be unable to avoid
hitting our own men as well![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]You know the consequences for dissent.
You shall do as I say![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]...They'll regret crossing me...
Heh heh heh...![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is the Saint's Tower.[A]
Saint Elimine's legendary weapon, the
Aureola spell tome, lies within.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Sir Douglas.
I appreciate your help.[A]
Especially because we were fighting
on opposite sides earlier...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You need not thank me.[A]
I do as my king commands.
There is nothing more to it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
That said, you saved Etruria. I am
honored to fight alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas...[A]

[0BE9]
[LoadWindham]Perish!
Every last one of you![A][Clear]
Everything to ash![A]
[0BEA]
[LoadWindham]Hahaha!
Haha...ha...[A]
[0BEB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,
I think we've found the tome.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Douglas,
is this it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas]Yes, it is.[A]
This is the Glorious Ascension,
Aureola, Saint Elimine's weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]May we make
use of it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The king said to take anything in
the tower that may be of use.[A]
The St. Elimine Church
backs us as well.[A]
If any oppose our use of it,
then I will negotiate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,
Sir Douglas.[A]
[0BEC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,
I think we've found the tome.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...This must be Aureola,
the Glorious Ascension.[A]
Merlinus,[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to give this back
to the St. Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
The king said we could take anything
we found in the tower.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is a holy relic of
their order.[A]
It would be sacrilegious to use it
without their permission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand...[A]
[0BED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father Yoder?
What is wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand you found
the Aureola tome...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes.[A]
I will return it to the
church immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no need.
We want you to take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you certain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What Saint Elimine wished
for was peace.[A]
Use it well and bring an
end to this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If you insist.[A]
