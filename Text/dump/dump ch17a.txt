Narcian has fallen then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So it seems.[A]
General Murdock, I still feel uncomfortable
that we didn't go to his aid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The king's orders explicitly
said to leave him on his own.[A]
Bern's army has no use for a man
who cannot manage his own messes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Sir Murdock...
What will you have us do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Arcardo, I leave Castle Remi
to you.[A]
Roartz, you will take
Castle Edessa.[A]
Make preparations to defend
against the enemy.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
What?!
Remi is right on the border![A]
The enemy will be here
in short time![A]
[OpenMidRight]That much is true.[A]
But this position gives us an invaluable
strategic advantage against Etruria.[A]
You must ensure that this castle does
not fall into enemy hands.[A]
[OpenLeft]Edessa lies all the way in
the outer tundra of Ilia...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, so you will have ample time
to prepare your defenses.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
...You...intend only to
take the defensive?[A]
You don't mean to
take back Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We play the waiting game for now.
We will take Etruria some day.[A]
And once we do, it will
be under Bern's jurisdiction.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]
What about us?! That's not
what we agreed upon![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Then perhaps you should find
a way to make yourself useful.[A]
You have done nothing to
deserve such renumeration.[A][Clear]
If you'll excuse us.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMurdock]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Those two will surely be killed.
Should we really leave them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
If they fall, it is because of their own
incompetence.[A]
Our army's code states that every officer
must be capable and self-sufficient.[A]
Perhaps they should have considered that
before joining us...[A][Clear]
The enemy leader... Roy, was it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Roy of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I admit he has rebuilt the
Lycian Army magnificently.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I thought it finished after
we crushed it the first time...[A]
I hope to cross blades with him
before the war is over.[A]
[0175]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]We will soon approach
the Etrurian border.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for everything,
Father Yoder.[A]
We've only made it this far thanks
to the assistance of the church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am only repaying your favor.[A]
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would
suffer great persecution from Bern.[A]
This is nothing compared to what you
did for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It was my pleasure to
help the church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
If I may be so bold...
Can I ask one more favor?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course,
if I am capable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you discover anything
else about the dragons...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Say no more.[A]
If I find anything new, I will
report to you immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have my eternal thanks.[A][ToggleSmile]
...Oh yes, I have some information
that may be of use.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]At a certain time of day, the sea level drops,
exposing a crossable sandbar.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]A sandbar?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It would take much time to make your
way around the bay to the castle.[A]
However, crossing the sandbar would
be a direct journey.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]I'll bear it in mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However you choose to proceed,
please be careful.[A]
Rushing forward has its
dangers as well.[A]
[OpenRight]Thank you for your advice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Not at all.[A]
May the Etrurian Army go with
Saint Elimine's blessing.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo!
A path has appeared in the sea![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
According to the locals, the tide
pulls out this time of day...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And you didn't know
about this sooner?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Milord, we are foreigners here!
We do not know this land![A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]Curses![A]
Charge! Don't allow the
enemy to cross that path![A]
[017A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,
we have a report.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Did the sandbar appear?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, Father Yoder
was right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did the enemy
know about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Actually, no. They seem to
be in a panicked state.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]
All right, then let's not
waste this opportunity![A]
Move forward![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager55]
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?
Then please take this staff.[A]
It was once used by the noble
Lady Tina...[A]
[017F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager50]
Did you know that at a
certain time of day,[A]
a sandbar appears
in the bay?[A]
It's a path right
through the ocean.[A]
Good luck![A]
[0180]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager56]
The tide is very dramatic
around here.[A]
I remember once I was getting
ready to go fishing,[A]
but by the time I had my boat ready,
the tide had already gone out.[A]
[0181]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]
W-why?![A]
What have I done to
deserve such a fate?![A]
[0182]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]
I...am a noble...
of Etruria...![A][Clear]
I cannot...die...in a place
such as this...[.....] Gah![A]
[0183]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarRight][SendToBack][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo...[A]
What a pathetic ending for
one of his stature.[A]
[OpenRight][SendToBack]
A year ago I myself never imagined
I would be leading an army.[A]
Fate can be unpredictable...[A]
Perhaps we'll even be able to
turn the tides against Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Lord Roy, what is that
in your hand?[A]
[OpenRight]Oh, this?
It's the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That tiny gemstone...?[A]
[OpenRight]
Princess Guinivere wanted me
to keep it.[A]
It seemed...difficult for her
to give it to me...[A]
I think she still hoped to end
the war with diplomacy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,
even if that seems unlikely.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Because Zephiel is the
treacherous king of Bern![A]
It is said that he murdered
his own father.[A]
I don't expect he would be
moved by family trust...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]
He killed his own father?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?[A]
Zephiel took the throne because
his father, King Desmond, passed on.[A]
But King Desmond's death was
very sudden.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]So there are rumors...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinivere
know about this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure she is at least
aware of the rumors.[A]
She may even know the
whole story.[A]
