...Then Narcian fell at Aquileia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milady.
We've received confirmation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadArcardo][OpenLeft][LoadRoartz]Lady Brunnya...
What will you have us do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have our protection,
Lord Roartz.[A]
You have helped us so much already.
We shall not neglect you.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I thank you...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Arcardo, I assign you to
defend this land of Talas.[A]
Lord Roartz, your post will be
the city of Bulgar.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Talas?! Here?![A]
But this is so close to Aquileia.
The enemy draws near![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Then stop them in their tracks.[A]
This region's proximity to Aquileia
makes it strategically invaluable.[A]
It would be an ideal base of operations
if the enemy can be repelled.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]That much is true...[A]
[OpenLeft]Bulgar...lies deep within Sacae.[A]
I hear there is great unrest
among the nomads...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Force them into submission.
That is your specialty, is it not?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rumor says that Roy, commander of
the attacking army, is but a boy.[A]
Even so, he has led his army to victory
through countless skirmishes and traps.[A]
Under his guidance, the Lycian Army
has been rebuilt stronger than ever.[A]
He has gone through greater hardships
than you, yet you complain?[A]
Do you intend to lose to a child?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]I must be off.
I pray for your success.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[097D]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]...Are you certain we should leave them?
They will surely fall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
They are disgraceful cowards who cast
away their homeland to save their necks.[A]
We owe them nothing. They should be grateful
to receive the few troops they have.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]We will soon approach
the Etrurian border.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for everything,
Father Yoder.[A]
We've only made it this far thanks
to the assistance of the church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am only repaying your favor.[A]
Had you not captured Aquileia, we would
suffer great persecution from Bern.[A]
This is nothing compared to what you
did for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It was my pleasure to
help the church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]If I may be so bold...
Can I ask one more favor?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course,
if I am capable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you discover anything
else about the dragons...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Say no more.[A]
If I find anything new, I will
report to you immediately.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have my eternal thanks.[A][ToggleSmile]
...Oh yes, one word of
caution before you go.[A]
The lands around here...[A]
They are surrounded by
high mountains and hills.[A]
It is also difficult to see
in the dark of the night...[A]
[OpenMidRight]These are ideal conditions
for an ambush...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
Castle Talas up ahead
is under Bern's control.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you for the advice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Not at all.[A]
May the Etrurian Army go with
Saint Elimine's blessing.[A]
[097F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadSacaeanVillager]
Ah, are you fighting against Bern?
Then please take this staff.[A]
It was once used by the noble
Lady Tina...[A]
[0980]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager31]
We don't get many visitors
up here...[A][Clear]
What?[A]
The enemy is planning to
attack our village?[A]
I'll make sure everyone
knows...[A]
I must thank you for
telling us.[A]
Please take this.[A]
[0981]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager34]
I hear there's a village
far to the northeast.[A]
I've never met anyone
who's been that far.[A]
I wonder if anyone still
lives there.[A]
[0982]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager28]
I saw some shady-looking
people in Bern's ranks.[A]
Probably thieves.[A]
You should tell the villagers
before they get ransacked.[A]
[0983]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]
W-why?![A]
What have I done to
deserve such a fate?![A]
[0984]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]
I...am a noble...
of Etruria...![A][Clear]
I cannot...die...in a place
such as this...[.....] Gah![A]
[0985]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarRight][SendToBack][ToggleSmile]Lord Arcardo...[A]
What a pathetic ending for
one of his stature.[A]
[OpenRight][SendToBack]
A year ago I myself never imagined
I would be leading an army.[A]
Fate can be unpredictable...[A]
Perhaps we'll even be able to
turn the tides against Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Lord Roy, what is that
in your hand?[A]
[OpenRight]Oh, this?
It's the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That tiny gemstone...?[A]
[OpenRight]
Princess Guinivere wanted me
to keep it.[A]
It seemed...difficult for her
to give it to me...[A]
I think she still hoped to end
the war with diplomacy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Perhaps she had faith in her brother,
even if that seems unlikely.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Because Zephiel is the
treacherous king of Bern![A]
It is said that he murdered
his own father.[A]
I don't expect he would be
moved by family trust...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]
He killed his own father?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Haven't you heard the rumors, Lord Roy?[A]
Zephiel took the throne because
his father, King Desmond, passed on.[A]
But King Desmond's death was
very sudden.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]So there are rumors...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, that Zephiel assassinated him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Does Princess Guinivere
know about this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure she is at least
aware of the rumors.[A]
She may even know the
whole story.[A]
