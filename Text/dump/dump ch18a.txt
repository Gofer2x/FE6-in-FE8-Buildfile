[OpenMidRight][LoadMartel][OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Father Martel![A]
We have brought the hermit
Niime as you asked.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.
Let her pass.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][FastPrint]What do you want from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You must be Niime,
the Mountain Hermit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm not aware of that nickname,
but I am Niime.[A]
I'm probably the one you seek.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We found an elder spell tome
within the castle.[A]
I hear that you may be capable
of using it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A]
I have dedicated my life to the study of
darkness and elder magic.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand that this spell can change
the weather surrounding the caster...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
Stranger spells are known to exist.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Then I order you to use the
tome to create rainfall.[A]
Make it rain so that the
rivers overflow.[A]
Push back the advancing
Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can try, but frankly I can't guarantee
that it will succeed.[A]
It is also important to remember that powerful
spells like this can only be cast once.[A]
Are you certain you want to do this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
No excuses, hag!
You will do as I say.[A]
You said you wish to join our
forces. Make yourself useful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0185]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere...[A]
We are approaching
Bern's army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, I know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
As we get closer, we will clash with
soldiers of Bern more and more.[A]
It will not be long before we
are in full combat with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to ask you something
before that happens.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Go ahead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I have heard rumors about
King Zephiel...[A]
I heard that he killed his father,
the previous king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
I could scarcely believe it
myself.[A]
You believe in him so strongly that
you cast away your own country.[A]
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as
the rumors say,[A]
I'm sure you would not have done
all that you have.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinivere,[A]
I accepted the Fire Emblem
not to use it in battle,[A]
but to find a way to end
this war peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think I have a right to know
the truth about the rumors...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]...What is the matter?[A]
Princess Guinivere looked
very troubled...[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...It's nothing to worry over.
Do you need something?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I have learned some troubling
information.[A]
A powerful dark mage by the name
of Niime fights in the enemy ranks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]A dark mage...
A druid, probably.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
In any case, she is apparently
extremely learned in ancient sorcery.[A]
She is said to be more knowledgable
than most scholars can even imagine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]We can't pull back now.
We press on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, but please
exercise caution.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.
We must tread lightly![A]
[0186]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadMartel]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is the spell ready,
Niime?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
...I'll warn you one more time.[A]
I can't guarantee the results will
be what you want...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Enough of your yammering!
Cast the spell![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Sigh... Very well...[A]
[0187]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]W-what's going on...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]An enemy spell caster?
Watch out, soldiers![A]
[0188]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadMartel][ToggleSmile]What...?!
What is this?![A]
The rivers...
They've frozen over![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well, I'll be...
That's not what I expected.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]You!
You did this on purpose![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Don't be absurd...[A]
I gave you ample warning that
I couldn't guarantee any results.[A]
[OpenRight]Enough! You there!
Toss her in the dungeon![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][NormalPrint]Yes, sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][SendToBack]Sigh...[A]
[0189]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What...happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy, we have a report.
The rivers have apparently frozen over.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The ice is so thick that even knights
on horseback can cross them safely.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh...[A]
Well, good. We can advance
more quickly now.[A]
Charge the castle gate![A]
[018A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager54]
I was told that this goddess icon
would bring me good luck...[A]
But I pray to it everyday,
and nothing happens.[A]
That con man tricked me!
Here, take it.[A]
Just looking at it
is making me angry.[A]
[018B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager60]
I was playing outside and
this ring fell from the sky![A][Clear]
...A gift from the gods?[A]
Nah, someone on a pegasus
or wyvern probably dropped it.[A]
Here, take it.
I prefer my dolls anyway.[A]
[018C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager56]
Are you the Etrurian Army?[A]
Sigh... Bern's army marched through
here just the other day, too.[A]
When will we have peace again?[A]
Here, take this.
Use it to end the war.[A]
[018D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager51]
That Martel who's guarding the castle...[A]
He said he has some secret weapon.
I'd be careful if I were you.[A]
[018E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager52]
When it gets colder the rivers
all freeze over,[A]
and we can get to the village in
the east without much trouble.[A]
But it's not quite the
season, unfortunately.[A]
[018F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49]
You look strong.[A]
But I bet you couldn't
beat the Sword Saint.[A]
They say he's on a
level all his own.[A]
[0190]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager58]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, are you the Etrurian Army
that the old lady was talking about?[A]
I heard she was originally
planning to join you guys,[A]
but for some reason she
joined up with Bern instead.[A]
What is she thinking?[A]
[0191]
[LoadMartel]
[ToggleSmile]Blast![A]
You made it through
this snow...[A]
Curse that useless woman![A]
[0192]
[LoadMartel]
[ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I'm too brilliant...
to die...[A]
[0193]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]At last, I am released
from Bern's dungeon.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am Niime.[A]
I live in the mountains where
I study arcane magic.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Why were you in the dungeon?[A]
Did you not join Bern of
your own choice?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, actually, I did,
but it was only a guise.[A]
Bern's army has something
I wish to study.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And what is that?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]!![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that sure got your
attention, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The dragons you speak of...[A]
They're not like the wyverns
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.[A]
They're strange troops that fight
alongside Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know that well.[A]
They're the same dragons that
were defeated in the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you know this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]At first I thought this was only
a simple act of aggression by Bern.[A]
But then I began to sense a strange
and...evil force among their troops.[A]
I decided to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did you learn anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons are very much shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls.[A]
I could only decipher so many of them.
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to the conclusion that Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The demon dragon...[A]
The leader of the dragons
that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The very same.[A]
Dragons are a much more advanced
species than us humans.[A]
Their vitality and intellect
puts that of humans to shame.[A]
There is one thing, however, the
dragons lack in.[A]
They multiply at a fraction of
the rate humans do.[A]
But the demon dragon...[A]
It had the power to create
more dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from
my research.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It can make dragons...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The demon dragon can create more
of its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[A]
I wish to learn more about
the dragons.[A]
I wield dark magic...
Let me join your army.[A]
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
We want to learn about
the dragons as well.[A]
It will be a perilous journey,[A]
but if that's acceptable to you,
you're welcome to join us.[A]
