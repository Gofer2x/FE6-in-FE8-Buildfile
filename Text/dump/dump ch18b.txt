The Etrurian Army
marches toward us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All according to plan.[A]
Draw them closer. They will rue
the day they crossed our path.[A]
Have the other clans been
notified?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They have indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
...The Etrurian Army will be an
easier foe than the Silver Wolf.[A]
They don't know this land.
They're unfamiliar with our ways.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The clans unite to fight against
foreign invaders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, such is the law of Sacae.[A]
None aided us against the Silver Wolf
because it was a clan dispute.[A]
But this is a foreign invasion.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The help from the other clans will
be valuable in this fight.[A]
With such a powerful ally as Bern,
however, they are expendable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly.[A]
There are some, though, who dislike the idea
of involving Bern in Sacaen matters.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I hear some clans have even joined
the Silver Wolf's guerrilla force.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He is a stubborn halfwit.[A]
His clan was defeated. He should
know better than to oppose us.[A]
He knows what becomes of those
who try to fight against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bern has subdued even powerful
cities like Bulgar with ease.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, and if they cannot be beaten,
we have no choice but to join them.[A]
This is our only path, and the
law of Sacae is unbreakable.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere...[A]
We are approaching
Bern's army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, I know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
As we get closer, we will clash with
soldiers of Bern more and more.[A]
It will not be long before we
are in full combat with Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to ask you something
before that happens.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Go ahead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I have heard rumors about
King Zephiel...[A]
I heard that he killed his father,
the previous king.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
I could scarcely believe it
myself.[A]
You believe in him so strongly that
you cast away your own country.[A]
If King Zephiel is truly as mad as
the rumors say,[A]
I'm sure you would not have done
all that you have.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Guinivere,[A]
I accepted the Fire Emblem
not to use it in battle,[A]
but to find a way to end
this war peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think I have a right to know
the truth about the rumors...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I...I'm sorry.
Please...give me some time.[A][ClearFace]

[098A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]His own father told him that?!
What a heartless man![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel held strong.[A]
He always said he never cared about
inheriting the throne.[A]
But the people of Bern knew of
Zephiel's genius and wanted him king.[A]
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]That's when he decided
to kill Zephiel...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Our father gave Zephiel a goblet full
of a poisoned drink at a banquet.[A]
That was the first and last time Zephiel
ever accepted a drink from our father.[A]
After returning to his room, Zephiel
began to fall dreadfully ill.[A]
For ten days and nights, Zephiel
lingered between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The old king made no further
attempts on his life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. At least, not to completion...[A]
I have heard that he schemed to have
Murdock and Zephiel's mother killed.[A]
He was scheming to murder everyone
connected to Zephiel.[A]
Upon learning of our father's intentions,
Zephiel feigned death.[A]
At his funeral service, our father leaned
over the coffin to view Zephiel's body.[A]
It was at that moment that Zephiel sprung
from the coffin and...sword in hand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]
I was but a child then, so naturally
I could not understand what was going on.[A]
All I knew at the time is that our father
died, and Zephiel never smiled again.[A]
Before then, he was stern at times,
but always a kind and loving brother.[A]
But after everything that happened...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I knew that someday I may
have to act against him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I...see...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
...Zephiel is so far-gone now.
He will never listen to anything I say.[A]
Roy, please...
You must stop him.[A]
Stop him from destroying Bern and
from destroying Elibe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Such a feat will likely
require my blade.[A]
Can you still ask such
a thing of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I trust your judgment.
Do what you must.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You have my word,
Princess Guinivere.[A]
I swear by the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel![A]
[098B]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Well, that sure got your
attention, didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The dragons you speak of...[A]
They're not like the wyverns
that Bern's soldiers ride upon.[A]
They're strange troops that fight
alongside Bern's soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know that well.[A]
They're the same dragons that
were defeated in the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Who are you, exactly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Niime.[A]
I live in the mountains where I study
arcane magic.[A]
Some call me Niime the Hermit.[A][Clear]
At first I thought this was only
a simple act of aggression by Bern.[A]
But then I began to sense a strange
and...evil force among their troops.[A]
I decided to investigate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did you learn anything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons are very much shrouded
in mystery.[A]
I looked through many ancient books
and scrolls.[A]
I could only decipher so many of them.
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have come to the conclusion that Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The demon dragon...[A]
The leader of the dragons
that Hartmut defeated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The very same.[A]
Dragons are a much more advanced
species than us humans.[A]
Their vitality and intellect
puts that of humans to shame.[A]
There is one thing, however, the
dragons lack in.[A]
They multiply at a fraction of
the rate humans do.[A]
But the demon dragon...[A]
It had the power to create
more dragons.[A]
That is what I learned from
my research.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It can make dragons...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The demon dragon can create more
of its kind.[A]
That would explain where Bern is
getting all of its dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That seems likely.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now, that being said...[A]
I wish to learn more about
the dragons.[A]
I wield dark magic...
Let me join your army.[A]
I'm sure I can be of some
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
We want to learn about
the dragons as well.[A]
It will be a perilous journey,[A]
but if that's acceptable to you,
you're welcome to join us.[A]

The clans shall unite

Such is the law

of the united clans...[A]
Such is the law

[0990]
[LoadMonke]Yes... That's it!
Closer... Closer...[A][Clear]
Right into our trap![A]
[0991]
[LoadMonke][ToggleSmile]Urkh...!
How could you defeat us...?[A][Clear]
My trap...was...perfect...[A]
[0992]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That was no easy feat.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But now we've hit our
enemy in Sacae hard.[A]
I'm sure that's not the
last of them, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure they will
retaliate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you have any idea
where they might be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Actually, the spy I sent out
earlier should be back by now.[A]
I will see if he's learned
anything.[A][ClearFace][.......][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,
Princess Guinivere?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I wish to tell you
about my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...You don't mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
I want you to know before
we enter Bern...[A]
I want you to know the
tragedies that have occurred.[A]
You asked before if my
brother murdered our father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To be frank...[.....]
he did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
King Zephiel killed his own
father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Our father tried to kill
Zephiel first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?!
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse
he took from our father.[A]
So he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
Why did--[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus]...Lord Roy![A]
We've located the enemy! They're
still planning their attack![A][Clear]
Hm? ...What is the matter?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]It is nothing...
Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...Did I appear at
a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's fine.
Where are they planning?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]In the city of Bulgar.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bulgar...
I've heard of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's the largest city in Sacae, but
it's under Bern's control now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand. We'll move
as soon as we can.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Why did the old king try
to murder his own son...?[A]
