[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
The enemy has arrived.[A]
They are just beyond
the mountains.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]It begins.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain,
are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]About what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
The Etrurian Army says they
will liberate us from Bern.[A]
They say they'll give us
our independence...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You can't be fool enough
to believe that.[A]
No one fights a war
without gain.[A]
Once they defeat Bern,
they intend to take over.[A]
It will be the same.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Bern are the better allies. They are
more experienced in warfare.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]
Come now, we have more
immediate problems.[A]
We must eliminate the enemy
that lies before us.[A]
Are the ballistae ready?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, the archers are all
at their stations.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good!
Fire at them from a distance.[A]
They'll be floundering around in
the dark of this powerful blizzard.[A]
Observe nature's wrath...[A]
[0195]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Such powerful wind and hail...
I can barely see in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ilia's winters are always like this.[A]
If you want to fight in this weather,
you'll have to put up with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We can't allow Bern time to regroup.
We must attack now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You're right.[A]
If the demon dragon is victorious,
it could be the end of us all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've been wondering...[A]
Do you think the demon dragon
is in human form as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It seems probable.[A]
It could be that all dragons in
this realm are in human form.[A]
I've even heard stories of dragons
in human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Arcadia...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What did you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er, nothing.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I've read that dragons only began to take
human form after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I expect you've heard of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but only in legend.[A]
I learned that in the Ending Winter,
the laws of nature were all warped.[A]
Day became night, and summer
became winter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn
that I couldn't decipher all of them.[A]
But one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nobody knows for certain...[A]
Legend says the dragons caused it by
releasing vast amounts of magical power,[A]
but even this theory lacks evidence.[A]
In any case, it is certain that dragons began
to take human form after the Ending Winter.[A]
I don't believe these two occurrences
are coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ultimately, 
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[0196]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGenericPegasusKnight][OpenMidRight][LoadSigune]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Captain![A]
Other pegasus knight squads
are on their way to assist us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
They will help immensely.[A]
I almost feel bad for the enemy...[A]
They'll be in a panic when they're
suddenly attacked from all directions.[A]
They won't see them coming in
this snowstorm...[A]
[0197]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager54]
You would come to such an
isolated place as this...?[A]
The prophecies were
correct...[A]
When the world is covered
in darkness...[A]
A single blade of wind will
slice through the darkness,[A]
allowing the light to
shine again.[A]
[0198]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager50]
I've pondered a lot about whether
I should give in to Bern...[A]
But I've made up my mind.
I'll hold strong.[A]
Take this ring. It brings out
your inner strength.[A]
...Please bring peace
back to this land.[A]
[0199]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager49]
Bern's headquarters in Ilia?[A]
Um, I think it was Edarza...
Edetta... Edessa! That's it.[A]
It's to the northeast.[A]
[019A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager51]
You know about the ballista
to the east, right?[A]
We're out of its range here,
but the shop over there isn't...[A]
[019B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager57]
[ToggleSmile]Pegasus knights and ballistae...
Captain Sigune is after you.[A]
She's hiding in the blizzard,
waiting to strike...[A]
[019C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager53]
You go up against Ivory Devil
Sigune. I wish you luck.[A]
The Ilian pegasus knights
can fly through the blizzard.[A]
You'll be blinded by the white...[A]
and then they will suddenly appear
out of the swirling snow.[A]
But when that happens it's too
late... You're already dead...[A]
[019D]
[LoadSigune]
So...you've made it through
the blizzard.[A][Clear]
Congratulations.[A]
Unfortunately, the only prize
that awaits you is death.[A]
[019E]
[LoadSigune]
...Dear me...[A]
I didn't anticipate
perishing here...[A]
But perhaps...
I was already dead...[A]
Perhaps I died...
a long...time ago...[A]
[019F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, I need you to send this
letter to Father Yoder in Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A letter?
May I ask what it says?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It has the information I learned
from Niime about the dragons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
What did you learn?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It would take too long to tell you.[A]
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so
you can look through it if you like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Very well.
I think I will...[A][ClearFace][.......][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong,
Princess Guinivere?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...I wish to tell you
about my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...You don't mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
I want you to know before
we enter Bern...[A]
I want you to know the
tragedies that have occurred.[A]
You asked before if my
brother murdered our father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To be frank...[.....]
he did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
King Zephiel killed his own
father to seize the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]No![A]
[OpenMidRight]No?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Our father tried to kill
Zephiel first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?!
Then King Zephiel...[A]
[OpenLeft]He couldn't bear the abuse
he took from our father.[A]
So he...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
Why did--[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]
The dragons are mysterious
creatures indeed... Hm?[A]
What is the matter?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]It is nothing...
Perhaps later...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Did I appear at
a bad time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's fine.
Did you send the letter?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Yes, I sent it off after
reading through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Why did the old king try
to murder his own son...?[A]
