They're here...!
And so soon...[A]
If only we had more time
to prepare our defenses![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKel]
We will try to stop the enemy
from progressing any further.[A]
Please retreat to the mansion
and fortify your defenses there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you think you can
succeed in stopping them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot say,
but we will try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
If you aren't confident you'll
be victorious, then I'll--[A]
[OpenMidRight]You'll what? Flee?[A]
Tell me, just where do
you think you can hide?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
General Brunnya has ordered
me to protect you.[A]
And so I shall, to the
very limits of my ability.[A]
But there may come a time when
you must take up arms as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...V-very well...[A]
Then I shall fortify the inside.
I leave the outside to you.[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
...That coward is the high
chancellor of Etruria?[A]
Why does he deserve our
protection?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not as if General Brunnya
cares for the man.[A]
She is obligated to protect him
because he turned to our side.[A]
Wretched though he may be, we
have a duty to fulfill.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
By the way, I understand the Silver
Wolf has been lurking around here.[A]
Keep on guard at all times and be
ready for anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A]
[0994]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must.[A]
I am sorry I've had no time
to speak with you at length.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not your fault.[A]
...If the blame lies with
anyone, it is my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]May I ask why your father tried
to murder King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
In actuality, I am his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was an Etrurian noblewoman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's correct.[A]
They were arranged to be wed for
political reasons.[A]
However, our father was already
in love with another woman.[A]
That was my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
The marriage between the king and
Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Our father didn't love Zephiel's
mother and always resented their son.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Was that the cause of all
the troubles that happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
I remember Zephiel working hard,
vying for our father's affection.[A]
He was a brilliant scholar and a
prodigy in combat.[A]
He grew to become a fine heir
to Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the
king try to--[A]
[OpenFarRight]Lord Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]Understood.
I only need a moment![A][Clear]
Princess Guinivere,
I am sorry, but I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I understand. Go.
Please be careful.[A]
[0995]
[OpenRight][LoadNiime][ToggleSmile]
Well, well...
It begins.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadDayan]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager32]
Bern's invasion finally ends, and now
here comes Etruria. Will it never end?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]Small wonder.
This is a large trading city.[A]
Any army would want control of it.[A]
If you'll excuse me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]H-hey, wait,
where are you going?[A]
[OpenRight]I'm going to observe the fight.
Let us see how good this Roy is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean now?
But...[A]
[OpenRight]Don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]What? Stop!
Don't leave me alone![A]
[0996]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKel]The reinforcements should be
arriving soon...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidLeft]
Open the front gate to let the
reinforcements in when they arrive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[A]
[0997]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKel][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft]Have the guerrilla forces hiding in
the houses commence their attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[A]
[0998]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]They'll be here any moment now...
Open the gate![A]
[0999]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager32]
I was selling weapons to Bern
before the war...[A]
But now that they've taken
over the city, they won't pay![A]
Here, take this wyrmslayer.
Just do something about them.[A][Clear]
I've been hiding it from them...
I think you can guess why...[A]
[099A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager30]
Would you like a special ring
from Etruria?[A]
I used to sell them, but I had to
close my shop because of the war.[A]
Here, take it. No charge...
No one will buy it anyway.[A]
[099B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager34]
This goddess icon
brings good luck.[A]
...I used to con people
by saying that.[A]
I can't do business
with this war, though.[A]
Here, take one.[A]
It won't really bring
you any luck, though.[A]
[099C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager36]
Wow... Lucky me!
Finders keepers.[A]
I bet I can sell
this thing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa!
A-are you from Bern?[A]
No, I didn't steal
this![A]
See ya![A]
[099D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager35]
This is a longbow, a favorite
of the Sacaen nomads.[A]
Here, take one.[A]
Use it to drive Bern's
soldiers out of here![A]
[099E]
[LoadKel]I am Kel.[A][Clear]
Behold my blade...as I swing
it for the last time.[A]
[099F]
[LoadKel]
This is the fate...
of all swordsmen...[A]
[09A0]
[OpenLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenLeft]I must say, you're not
half bad at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-who are you!?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]I told you to stop![A]
You may not enter.
Lord Roy is not accepting visitors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's going on?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
She was very insistent about
seeing you.[A]
But you have more important
matters to attend to.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Just hear me out first.[A]
I think I have some information
you might want to hear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...And what would that be?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
It is about the dragons
who are in human form.[A]
[OpenMidRight][......][ToggleSmile]...I wish to speak
with her in private.[A]
Will you leave us, please?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Yes, milord.[A][ClearFace]
