//Chapter 2

[4D]

[OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft][LoadRuud][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All I want to know is what
happened to Princess Guinivere![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-yes, Captain Melady...[A]
I'm certain she was in her room this
morning, but she simply vanished...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]You told me that already, you buffoon![A]
I don't want excuses! Are you so
incompetent you can't understand that?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint]Well... I... Er...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Our forces are mobilizing to
begin a full-scale war with Lycia.[A]
How are we to focus on the battle
if the princess is missing?![A]
Naturally, you will take full
responsibility for her disappearance.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I never should have let Her Highness
come to the border to begin with.[A]
I will return to Bern and inform
the king of this matter.[A]
I'll try not to cause a panic, but I can't
promise your life if the princess isn't found.[A]
I trust you'll take every measure to
locate her as soon as possible.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Captain![A]

[4E]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRuud][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Is Princess Guinivere
secure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, Commander. She's under constant
surveillance in the cellar.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good.
Don't let her escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Commander...[A]
Are you sure this
is a good idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Of course I'm sure![A]
The younger sister of King Zephiel...[A]
We're sure to get a hefty sum turning
her over to one of Bern's enemies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Loyalty to one's king.
Bah. What a worthless notion.[A]
The world is ruled by neither king
nor queen. It's ruled by gold![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indubitably, Commander.[A]
...But there has been a
snag, shall we say.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just received a report...[A]
It seems that Princess Guinivere's
lady-in-waiting has escaped...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?! You lout, why didn't
you say so earlier?[A][Clear]
Find her this instant!
Don't let her get away![A]

[4F]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy,
this is the location.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is where we're supposed
to meet the mercenaries?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, though it seems
they aren't here yet.[A]
[Clear]Wait, who's that? Somebody's
coming this way...[A]

[50]

[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
Be careful there![A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, forgive me!
I'm in such a hurry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No need for apologies.[A]
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
Thank you, good sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Farewell, then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you from Lycia,
by chance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am.[A]
I am the son of
Marquess Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Saint Elimine! Thank you
for guiding me to this boy![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pardon?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Please, I need your help
to rescue my mistress.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What happened?[A]
[OpenRight]My name is Elen. I am a
cleric of Saint Elimine.[A]
My mistress and I came from Bern to seek
an audience with the lords of Lycia.[A]
However, Commander Ruud of the
castle east of here trapped us.[A]
We were captured, imprisoned
by our own countrymen.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]
Lord Roy![A]
We must avoid unnecessary
entanglements with Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But we can't neglect a noble of Bern who
wants to speak with the lords of Lycia.[A]
...Then again, we can't simply charge
into enemy territory either...[A][Clear]
Wait, who's there?![A]

[51]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[ToggleSmile]There she is![A]
Over here, boys!
Get the girl![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our orders say
dead or alive![A]

[52]

[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][ToggleSmile]Oh dear...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
Well, Merlinus, they provoked hostilities.
I don't think we have any choice now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You wouldn't listen even
if we did, I'm sure.[A]
But no matter. Let me witness all you've
learned about tactics in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, everyone!
We're going to charge the castle![A]
Sister Elen, you should
find a place to hide...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElen]No, I will
come with you.[A]
I cannot fight, but I can
heal wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm the one that got you
tangled up in this mess.[A]
Please let me do what I can to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]OK, but just stay behind
us so you aren't hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Certainly. Thank you
for the concern.[A]

[53]

[OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][ToggleSmile]They should be around
here somewhere...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Shanna, [OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]check around and try to
find the soldiers from Pherae, will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure![A]

[54]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]So Big Man, who's our
client this time?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]House Pherae, one of the
noble families of Lycia.[A]
The marquess's son is going to join the
other armies of the Lycian League.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][ToggleSmile]We're going up
against Bern then?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Looks that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][FastPrint]Finally, a foe worthy of my axe!
Let's show 'em what we're made of![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][ToggleSmile]Bern, eh? This won't be easy, I can
tell you that. We had best tread lightly.[A]

[55]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I think I've found them![A]
[ToggleSmile]But it looks like they're already
caught up in a skirmish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What? The fighting's
started already?[A]
Let's get a move on then.
Time to earn our pay![A]

[56]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Are you Lord Roy of
House Pherae?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who is it that's asking?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Name's Dieck.[A]
You should've heard about me from
an older man named Merlinus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're the leader of
the mercenary band?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Just a small company, really.[A]
Sorry we're late.[A]
Didn't think the fighting
would start so soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Well... There was
a complication...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Don't take it the wrong way.
We don't blame you.[A]
Actually, quite the contrary.[A]
My boys are excited for a chance
to show off their skills.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Brilliant. It sounds like you're just
the caliber of fighters we need.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Enough chitchat then.[A]
Let's wrap things up.[A]

[57]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]Flying units may be weak against bows, but
you can use that against your enemies too.[A]
If a pegasus or wyvern comes close, you
can tear 'em apart with arrows![A]

[58]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]Armored knights have nearly
impenetrable defenses.[A]
But some weapons, like this sword,
can pierce their armor.[A]
I'm sure you can get better use out
of it than us. Please, take it.[A]

[59]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager12]Pegasi are useful for flying to
hard-to-reach places.[A]
But woe to any rider who finds
herself against an archer.[A]
An arrow can make short work
of a pegasus![A]

[5A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]The weapon triangle...
Swords, axes, and lances.[A]
Remember, swords best axes, axes best
lances, and lances best swords.[A]
Keep this in mind and things
will be much easier for you.[A]

[5B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]Forts are the key to a good defense.[A]
If you're in a fort, you can defend
and even dodge more easily.[A]
On top of that, your wounds
will heal slowly over time.[A]

[5C]

[LoadRuud][ToggleSmile]Curse it all![A]
Just when I thought things had
finally turned my way...[A]

[5D]

[LoadRuud][ToggleSmile]Oof...[A]
Greed can only...bring
you...an ill fate...[A]

[5E]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
There was a woman locked
in the cellar![A]
[OpenRight]That must be Elen's mistress.
Bring her here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[ToggleSmile][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere]

[5F]

[OpenFarRight][LoadElen]Your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen!
I'm so relieved you're well.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You put yourself in such danger
running off like you did...[A]
I worried myself sick about you.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I am sorry, Your Highness, but I couldn't
leave you in that dank cellar...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry yourself, Elen.
It's thanks to you I am safe now.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

[60]

[OpenMidLeft]I am in your debt.
May I ask your name...?[A]
[OpenRight]I am Roy, son of Eliwood,
Marquess Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure...
As for myself...[A]

[61]

[OpenFarRight][LoadElen][ToggleSmile]Your Highness... Are you
certain you should?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Elen. It is fine.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

[62]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My name is
Guinivere.[A]
[OpenRight]Guinivere?![A]
That's the name of the
princess of Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is I.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]What?![A]
This was a trap,
wasn't it?![A]
[OpenRight]Merlinus, hold.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]I beg your pardon,
Lord Roy, but...[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I wish to hear her out.
Give her a chance, will you?[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tsk. As you will...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]You are truly Princess
Guinivere from Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, truly. I cannot blame you
for doubting me, however.[A]
[OpenRight]Maybe you are the princess of Bern,
and maybe you aren't.[A]
I can see from your actions and dress
that you are at least of high status.[A]
If you are indeed Princess Guinivere, however,
there's one thing I don't understand.[A]
Elen told me you intended to meet
the lords of the Lycian League.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is correct.[A]
[OpenRight]Why, if you are the sister
of the king of Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to find a peaceful
way to end the war.[A]
If I can speak to the Lycian council, I'm
certain we can come to a solution.[A]
[OpenRight]Your brother instigated this war.
Is it in your power to stop it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]At the very least, I wish to do everything
I can. No, I MUST do everything I can.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
For the time being, come with us to
meet the Lycian League armies.[A]
I want to see what Lord Hector
thinks of this affair.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You will allow me
to accompany you?[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. If there is any possibility to
avoid further bloodshed, we must try.[A]
It matters not how small the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you![A]
I truly am in your debt...[A]
