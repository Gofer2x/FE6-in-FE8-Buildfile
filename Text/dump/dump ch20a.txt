Well?
How does it look?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
Actually, milord...we've requested aid
from Ilia's knights,[A]
but all but those directly under
Sir Murdock seem reluctant to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Curses! Things couldn't
possibly get any worse...[A][Clear]
Ah, but we did capture
Zelot's wife.[A]
What is the word on Zelot's
troop? Have they responded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, milord...[A]
They are traveling mercenary knights,
so we do not know their location.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Blast it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Ever since Sigune's defeat,[A]
Ilia's militia has been hesitant
to attack the Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Cowards! Every last one of them![A]
The great High Chancellor Roartz will
not die in this miserable wasteland![A]
[01A1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager57][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Cough...cough...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJuno][CloseSpeechFast]Are you all right?
Here, take my shawl.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I couldn't.
You'll freeze...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I can handle it.
I'm used to these temperatures.[A]
This is nothing compared to
flying through a blizzard.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...Thank you.
Cough...cough...[A][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager54][ToggleSmile]Lady Juno...
What's going to happen?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...I don't know.
But we must stay hopeful.[A]
The enemy may retreat, or
perhaps Zelot might return.[A]
This isn't the end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Where is Sir Zelot now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
His last letter said he planned to join
the Lycian Army, but after that...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, he may be closer than
we realize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I hope you're right.[A]
[01A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We fight again today.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must.[A]
Once we take this castle,[A]
it will be our new base
before we enter Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
May I ask why your father tried
to murder King Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Zephiel and I have different mothers.
In actuality, I am his half sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that Zephiel's mother
was an Etrurian noblewoman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's correct.[A]
They were arranged to be wed for
political reasons.[A]
However, our father was already
in love with another woman.[A]
That was my mother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
The marriage between the king and
Zephiel's mother was forced.[A]
Our father didn't love Zephiel's
mother and always resented their son.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Was that the cause of all
the troubles that happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
I remember Zephiel working hard,
vying for our father's affection.[A]
He was a brilliant scholar and a
prodigy in combat.[A]
He grew to become a fine heir
to Bern's throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Then why did the
king try to--[A]
[OpenFarRight]Lord Roy!
We are ready for the attack![A]
[OpenRight]Understood.
I only need a moment![A]
[Clear]Princess Guinivere,
I am sorry, but I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I understand. Go.
Please be careful.[A]
[01A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]Brrrr![A]
I knew Ilia was cold, but I
didn't think it was THIS cold![A]
And there's just snow
everywhere you look![A]
[ToggleSmile]The pure white...
It's beautiful in a way...[A]
Whoops, no time to admire
the scenery.[A]
I'm here for the moolah...[A]
[01A4]
[OpenLeft][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The blizzard is picking up...[A]
This might take longer than
we expected.[A]
We should head for Bern as soon
as we take the castle.[A]
[01A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Sister! Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shanna? What are
you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm with the Etrurian Army.[A]
I was surprised when I heard
Edessa was taken by Bern,[A]
but I knew you'd be OK.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Oh? Why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You were a captain of the
pegasus knights![A]
There's no way Bern could
defeat you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, you'll be sorry to hear
that I was captured.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]That's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
But I don't intend to surrender
to Bern.[A]
All I could do on my own was try to
keep the people in the castle safe,[A]
but if I join you, I actually stand
a fighting chance against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then are you going to
fight with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Really? Hurray![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's so exciting
about that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I became a pegasus knight because
I wanted to be just like you.[A]
Fighting alongside you is like
a dream come true.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? I'm honored...[A]
You always have tended to
go overboard with things...[A]
[01A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadThea]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thea...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It's a long story...
But I'm with the Etrurian Army now.[A]
I'd heard that Edessa had fallen
to Bern so I was worried, but...[A]
I'm glad to see that you're
all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'd heard that you were
fighting against this army.[A][Clear]
You didn't betray...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No! Never![A]
I never betrayed the code.[A]
I did everything I was
supposed to.[A]
I just eventually ended
up in the Etrurian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course...[A]
You're a good and diligent soldier.
I should have known better.[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's all right...[A]
But, um...
What are you wearing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[A]
Why, this is my combat uniform.
Don't you remember it?[A]
What do you think?[A]
Think I can still make a
decent captain?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, but I
thought you retired.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]With such dire stakes I had no
choice but to come out of retirement.[A]
On my own all I could do was
defend the people in the castle,[A]
but if I join you, I can actually
strike back against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then you're going to
fight alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's what
I'm getting at.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]That makes me so happy![A]
I never thought I'd be able to
fight alongside you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't get ahead of yourself.[A]
You still have a long way
to catch up to me![A]
[01A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zelot![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Are you all right?
You're not hurt?[A]
If any of them laid a
finger on you, I'll--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Zelot, I'm not a child.
I used to be a captain, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I know,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.
They didn't do anything to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Why are you in the
Etrurian Army?[A]
I thought you were
with Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, it's a long story...[A]
What it comes down to is that this
is the Etrurian Army only in name.[A]
It's actually made up primarily of
soldiers from the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Oh... Interesting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry I wasn't here
when you needed me most...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is no use for
regret at this point.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]But you were forced
to fight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh? I thought you liked
my combat uniform.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I do!
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
You'll be seeing a lot
more of it from now on...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What?!
Do you mean...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I do.[A]
I will fight
alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No! I can't accept that.
You retired years ago.[A]
Leave the fighting
to us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I may have retired, but I still had to
take up arms to defend the castle.[A]
Zelot, this world isn't safe anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I will fight.[A]
I want to bring peace back
to this land.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Next is Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]Lord Roy![A]
Many of Bern's troops have been
spotted in the ruins outside Edessa![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ruins?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Reports say the ruins are home to a
lance that was used in the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][FastPrint]That lance...
Is it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is most probably a
legendary weapon.[A]
[OpenRight]Then we must hurry
to the ruins![A]
[01AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Guinivere, the attack
on Bern will commence soon.[A]
So may I ask...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...The rest of the story.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You said King Zephiel was an outstanding
pupil in everything he did...[A]
It sounds like he would have been an
ideal heir to the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have no doubt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
But still your father never
looked kindly at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In truth...our father began to despise
Zephiel precisely because of his talent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Why...would a father resent
his own son's talent...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Our father was a man of
unextraordinary skill and intellect.[A]
Zephiel's outstanding talents made
our father colder towards him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]He was envious...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
He went as far as to tell Zephiel
that he would never inherit Bern.[A]
He said that instead, the throne
would go to my future husband.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]His own father told him that?!
What a heartless man![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But Zephiel held strong.[A]
He always said he never cared about
inheriting the throne.[A]
But the people of Bern knew of
Zephiel's genius and wanted him king.[A]
Pressured by the public, our father
lost his patience at last...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]That's when he decided
to kill Zephiel...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Our father gave Zephiel a goblet full
of a poisoned drink at a banquet.[A]
That was the first and last time Zephiel
ever accepted a drink from our father.[A]
After returning to his room, Zephiel
began to fall dreadfully ill.[A]
For ten days and nights, Zephiel
lingered between life and death.[A]
But Murdock, Zephiel's teacher and
loyal general, saved his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The old king made no further
attempts on his life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. At least, not to completion...[A]
I have heard that he schemed to have
Murdock and Zephiel's mother killed.[A]
He was scheming to murder everyone
connected to Zephiel.[A]
Upon learning of our father's intentions,
Zephiel feigned death.[A]
At his funeral service, our father leaned
over the coffin to view Zephiel's body.[A]
It was at that moment that Zephiel sprung
from the coffin and...sword in hand...[A]
