[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadTick][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Tick!
The enemy is advancing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't panic.[A]
The path through the
ruins is blocked off.[A]
They're not getting
in here so easily.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
But the enemy has had so many
victories against Ilia's troops![A]
Even many of our own men have
fallen to them.[A]
I don't see how we can expect
victory...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We don't need a victory.[A]
General Murdock said that we
simply must hold our ground.[A]
We defend until the enemy
gives up and leaves.[A]

I believe that Maltet, the Blizzard
Spear, lies in these ruins.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Blizzard Spear...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Barigan the Holy Knight used it
during the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Barigan?
He's a hero to all knights.[A]
I studied him a great deal.[A]
He was honorable in
everything he did.[A]
...This building seems to
have walls everywhere.[A]
Is there a way inside?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bern's forces most likely blocked the
pathways to cover their tracks.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then they must have been
in a rush...[A]
Maybe the walls are weak in
certain areas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is quite possible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right.
Let's do what we can.[A]

[LoadTick][ToggleSmile]No...
This is a nightmare.[A][Clear]
How did you get
through those walls?[A]
[0BF4]
[LoadTick]You have bested us...
You may pass...[A][Clear]
But you will know Bern's
true power soon...[A]

The lance is here![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...This is Barigan's
lance Maltet...[A]
It's beautiful, as if
it were made of ice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy,
Bern's troops are fleeing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.
Let them go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let them go?
We must attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, don't.
We've already won.[A]
They don't want to
fight us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]They all have lives
and families.[A]
There's no need to take
that away from them.[A]
