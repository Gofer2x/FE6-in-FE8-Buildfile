[OpenMidRight][LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]
The worthless fools outside failed!
The enemy is in the mansion![A]
[MoveMidRight]Blast it![A]
If I die I'm taking
that Roy down with me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]Lord Roartz![A]
The remnants of the Djute say they'll come
to our aid after they hide Mulagir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mulagir?[.....]
Ah, one of the legendary weapons.[A]
Good. Then we must
simply hold out until then![A]
[09A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is Roartz's manor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This mansion's framework is big enough
to hide troops and ballistae.[A]
You won't be safe with your back up
against the wall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know much
about this place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Probably more than most, anyway.
That's what I'm known for.[A]
I picked up that bit of
information back in the city.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you know what the
demon dragon looks like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't say that I do.[A]
Still, I would relish the opportunity
to see it with my own eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been wondering...[A]
Do you think the demon dragon
is in human form as well?[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]It seems probable.[A]
It could be that all dragons in
this realm are in human form.[A]
I've even heard stories of dragons
in human form living with people.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Arcadia...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
What did you say?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've read that dragons only began to take
human form after the Ending Winter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Ending Winter...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I expect you've heard of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but only in legend.[A]
I learned that in the Ending Winter,
the laws of nature were all warped.[A]
Day became night, and summer
became winter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's it.[A]
The scrolls I read on the topic are so timeworn
that I couldn't decipher all of them.[A]
But one thing is clear.[A]
The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful
enough to bend and twist the whole planet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What caused it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nobody knows for certain...[A]
Legend says the dragons caused it by
releasing vast amounts of magical power,[A]
but even this theory lacks evidence.[A]
In any case, it is certain that dragons began
to take human form after the Ending Winter.[A]
I don't believe these two occurrences
are coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ultimately,
the truth lies in Bern.[A]
[09A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSacaeGaidenBosses]Pigs from Etruria...![A]
I will avenge the Djute
right here, right now![A]
[09A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan]
The manor is in chaos.
Now is my chance.[A]
I will take down Bern's
troops on my own![A]
[09A5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]
Soooo...[A]
Bulgar, huh? The biggest
city in Sacae.[A]
I heard it was sacked by Bern.
Look at all the soldiers...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sure there are plenty of
goodies just waiting to be swiped.[A]
[09A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you the general of
the Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am. And you are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Dayan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dayan...?
I feel I've heard the name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, allow me to thank you.[A]
My clan has been fighting against
Bern and their followers.[A]
We haven't a chance against them
head on,[A]
so we've resorted to guerrilla
tactics.[A]
Since your arrival, however, the
odds are tipping in our favor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am glad that I could help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That said, I wish to ask
you one thing.[A]
Once this battle is over,
I request that you withdraw.[A]
[OpenMidRight]After this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacae belongs to the Sacaens.[A]
If Bern's iron-fisted rule is only
to be replaced by Etruria's,[A]
then you will leave us no choice
but to fight against you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry... I cannot comply with
that request.[A]
We must base ourselves in Sacae to
launch our direct attack on Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You...plan to attack Bern directly?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if we push Bern back now, it's only
a matter of time until they strike back.[A]
We must bring the fight to their heartland
to stop this war. Do you not agree?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I do.[A]
I see...[A]
In that case, I
shall join you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That would help tremendously.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But once Bern is defeated, you must
withdraw your troops from Sacae.[A]
Do I have your word?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
I swear it.[A]
[09A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSue]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandfather...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue?!
You are unharmed?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks to this army, yes.[A]
But I was the only one of
our clansmen to survive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... You've been
through much.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grandfather, come with us.
This army will not invade Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Are you certain?[A]
[OpenMidRight]As certain as the Sky is blue
and the Earth is green.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.
I trust your word.[A]
[09A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]Chieftain![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sin, you've returned!
Now you can join our fight...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But Chieftain...[A]
I am currently in service
to this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you mean the
Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
This army will not invade Sacae.
Will you lend us your skills?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.
I trust your word.[A]
I will fight with you.[A]
[09A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSue]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandfather...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sue?!
You are unharmed?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks to this army, yes.[A]
But I was the only one of our
clansmen to survive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see... You've been
through much.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grandfather, do you
fight with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have joined this group.[A]
I don't believe that this army
will try to take Sacae from us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I agree...[A]
[09AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]Chieftain![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sin, you've returned!
We fight together again...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chieftain...[A]
Have you joined
this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have indeed.[A]
I don't believe they intend
to take Sacae from us.[A]
What do you think of them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.
They mean well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.
Then we fight together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Chieftain.[A]
[09AB]
[LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]S-someone!
Come to my aid![A][Clear]
All is lost if I fall![A]
[09AC]
[LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]W-wait... Serve me!
It is not too late...[A]
I shall...absolve you
of your crimes...[A][Clear]
Guh...![A]
[09AD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Next is Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy![A]
We have reports that remnants of the
Djute are hiding in some nearby ruins.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ruins?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and a captive tells us there's a bow
there that was used in the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's likely that it's
a legendary weapon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We must get to those ruins!
Let's go![A]
[09AE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, I need you to send this
letter to Father Yoder in Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A letter?
May I ask what it says?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It has the information I learned
from Niime about the dragons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
What did you learn?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It would take too long to tell you.[A]
I haven't sealed the letter yet, so
you can look through it if you like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Very well.
I think I will...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere]...Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]...We will enter Bern now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, the attack on Bern
will commence soon.[A]
May I...ask the rest of
the story now?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]...That is why I came to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said King Zephiel was an outstanding
pupil in everything he did...[A]
It sounds like he would have been an
ideal heir to the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I have no doubt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
But still your father never
looked kindly at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In truth...our father began to despise
Zephiel precisely because of his talent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Why...would a father resent
his own son's talent...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Our father was a man of
unextraordinary skill and intellect.[A]
Zephiel's outstanding talents made
our father colder towards him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]He was envious...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
He went as far as to tell Zephiel
that he would never inherit Bern.[A]
He said that instead, the throne
would go to my future husband.[A]
