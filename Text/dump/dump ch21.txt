General Murdock. All troops are
at their posts and ready for battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Thank you.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][Clear][OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle]
[OpenMidRight]Galle.
It will begin soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My men are ready.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Your squad will be the key to
victory in this battle.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Of course, Sir Murdock.
I won't disappoint you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I expect not.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The enemy are but insects next
to the might of Bern's army.[A]
Even so...that Lycian general
has made it far.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]General Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. Roy.[A]
I hope to be able to duel him in
a fair fight, one on one.[A]
[01B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ah, General Roy!
I have found you at last.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Father Yoder![A]
What brings you all
the way from Etruria?[A]
Is something amiss?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][LoadOverworldFaces]
I did some additional research
after reading your letter.[A]
I reached the same conclusion. Bern
has resurrected the demon dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You think so, too?[A]
...Hartmut defeated the
demon dragon in the Scouring.[A]
How could Bern have brought
it back to life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Apparently after defeating it,
Hartmut chose to spare its life.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Instead of killing it, he sealed
it away in the mountains of Bern.[A]
The sword he used to seal it was...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Binding Blade?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, you know of it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I learned a little bit
of it in my studies...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
The demon dragon's seal may have been
broken, but with the Binding Blade,[A]
we may be able to seal it away once
more or kill it for good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you know where the
demon dragon might be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I believe so.[A]
We know dragons change into
human form,[A]
and the demon dragon is most
likely in such a form as well.[A]
I have a suspect already.[A]
The "Dark Priestess" that is
always at King Zephiel's side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]The Dark Priestess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
There is no solid evidence that
she is the demon dragon,[A]
but she appeared shortly before
the other dragons did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]
The dragons seal away their power
in gems called dragonstones.[A]
Remaining in their dragon form
uses too much energy otherwise.[A]
The same is likely true for
the demon dragon as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We must see her in person
and find the truth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Allow me to go with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
You will fight alongside us?
By all means![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I have also been instructed
to give you these.[A]
They are legendary weapons
that the church located.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Legendary weapons?!
These will be invaluable![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
If the demon dragon has been released,[A]
then this is the greatest crisis
mankind has faced since the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We must rise like the Eight Legends
of yore to save humanity once again.[A]
[01B5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGalle]
[ToggleSmile]
Knights of Bern!
We strike now![A]
Leave none alive![A]
Don't even leave them
time to scream in fear![A]
[01B6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeres][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Have you dealt with the
legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes sir, it has
been disposed of.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
Now we go to General
Murdock's aid![A]
[01B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][ToggleSmile]Galle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Melady...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Galle...
I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not speak...[A]
You and I are both
loyal knights.[A]
We both fight in our
masters' names.[A]
That is all there is
to know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Melady...[A]
This is probably the end,
so let me say this.[A]
I am truly grateful I was
fortunate enough to meet you.[A]
We trained together, and we
fought alongside each other.[A]
Melady...
The days I spent with you...[A]
They were the happiest days
of my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
M...mine, too...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Good-bye, Melady.[A]
My only regret is that we didn't
meet in a more peaceful time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Galle...[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Wait![A]
Galle![A]
Don't go![A]
Gaaalle!![A]
[01B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGalle][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Galle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.
You seem to be well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Galle...
Must we truly fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.
We must.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I don't want to
fight you![A]
You're the last
person I ever...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss!
Are you a child?![A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Did you have this little faith in
your choice when you left Bern?[A]
Do you regret your decision to
fight against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No! My mind is...set...[A]
It still hurts to point my blade
towards Bern, my homeland...[A]
But the path I chose was not
a mistake...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then cast away your hesitation![A]
Focus on defeating those who block
the path that you have chosen.[A][Clear]
...No matter who that may be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Galle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss...
Are you a knight of Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Of course![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![A]
Then when next we meet,
there will be no words.[A]
Our blades will cross, and
one will be left standing![A]
[01B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Father Yoder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Saul, it is good to see
you well.[A]
And thank you.[A]
You and Dorothy have done a
great service to the church.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...There is no greater pleasure
than to know I have been of use.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh? I've never known you
to be so serious...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father Yoder, despite all
appearances, I am a priest.[A]
The common good is my
greatest concern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am sorry I doubted you.[A]
From this point, we
fight together.[A]
[01BA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy,
have you been well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very much so.[A]
It is good to see
you, Father Yoder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are always so cheery and
full of energy.[A]
I'm sure Saint Elimine
adores that about you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Just being around you cleanses the
heart and makes one feel pure.[A]
I'm sure that's true even for Saul.
You have much to be proud of.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,
Father Yoder![A]
[01BB]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I was but a child then, so naturally
I could not understand what was going on.[A]
All I knew at the time is that our father
died, and Zephiel never smiled again.[A]
Before then, he was stern at times,
but always a kind and loving brother.[A]
But after everything that happened...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I knew that someday I may
have to act against him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I...see...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Zephiel is so far-gone now.
He will never listen to anything I say.[A]
Roy, please...
You must stop him.[A]
Stop him from destroying Bern and
from destroying Elibe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Such a feat will likely
require my blade.[A]
Can you still ask such
a thing of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I trust your judgment.
Do what you must.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You have my word,
Princess Guinivere.[A]
I swear by the Fire Emblem
that I will stop King Zephiel![A]
[01BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4][ToggleSmile]
You're the Etrurian Army,
aren't you?[A]
There are no soldiers
here.[A]
Take this. Just leave
us in peace![A]
[01BD]
[LoadMurdock]
Hm...
You have made it far.[A][Clear]
I congratulate you.
But can you defeat me?[A]
[01BE]
[LoadMurdock]
Hngh...!
You...are strong...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Zephiel... My king...[A]
I cannot protect you...
any further...[A]
Forgive me...![A]
[01BF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy... There is a path
leading underground here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is the Binding Blade
down that way?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I cannot say...[A]
But a captive tells us that there
are two weapons in this shrine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait, is that right?[A]
Does that mean that there
is another legendary weapon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Possibly...[A]
Perhaps we should ask those in
our army who hail from Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]
Yes, I'll see if
they know anything.[A]
[01C0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy.
This sword in the altar...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]This must be the Binding Blade.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]
...I can't seem to draw it from the stone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]It's sealed in the altar.
We must use the Fire Emblem.[A]
[OpenLeft]Use it? How?[A]
[OpenRight]
Princess Guinivere said that it goes
in the socket on the hilt...[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]Whoa!
What's happening...?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]The blade is glowing![A]
[OpenRight]Now I should be able
to draw it...![A]
[Clear][ToggleMouthMove]......!...[ToggleSmile][A][ToggleMouthMove]
[01C1]
[OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[......][ToggleSmile]...What...
are these images...?[A][......]
Are they the
Binding Blade's...[A][......][Clear]
No, Hartmut's
memories...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIdunnHuman][......][ClearFace][OpenRight][Clear][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[ToggleMouthMove][Clear]Who was that?[A][......][Clear]
I don't understand what
I'm feeling. It's very...[ToggleSmile][A]
[01C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy?
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenRight]Yes...
I'm fine.[A][Clear]
So this is Hartmut's sword,
the Binding Blade...[A]
Am I really worthy to
wield it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin][CloseSpeechFast]
It is said that truly magnificent
swords choose their owners.[A]
The sword is in your hands now.
It has chosen you.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]
But anyone with the Fire Emblem
could have taken it...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
In theory, perhaps so...[A]
But it was you who reached it.
This is fate.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadMerlinus]
Now that we have the Binding Blade,
all that's left is the king of Bern.[A]
We mustn't tarry![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...You're right!
Zephiel must be stopped![A]
