The battle was lost...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it appears so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I wish I could have been at General
Murdock's side when he fell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I share your feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We carry out our final orders from
General Murdock as planned.[A]
We will defend the legendary weapon
to our deaths if need be.[A]
Apocalypse, the Elder Revelation,
must not fall into enemy hands![A]
[0C01]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
There is a legendary weapon
in this place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I believe so.[A]
All I've heard are rumors from other
soldiers,[A]
but there is apparently a tome meant
to protect the shrine from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]
I agree that the tome is
likely a legendary weapon.[A]
Bern's troops are present
as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We will soon fight Zephiel himself.[A]
...We need as many legendary weapons
as we can obtain before then.[A]
We must get that tome.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady]
I have also heard that there are
numerous traps placed about.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Traps?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and they are supposedly
very well-crafted at that.[A]
Most of us probably lack the
dexterity to disarm them,[A]
but thieves may be able to
take care of them.[A]
In any case, do be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we must stay
on our guard.[A]
[0C02]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]
This is where the legendary weapon
is, Princess Guinivere?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Most likely...[A]
All I know is that there is a tome here
meant to protect the shrine from intruders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadElffin]I agree that the tome is

[LoadPeres]
Darkness from an age
long forgotten...[A][Clear]
I will show you its power.[A]
[0C05]
[LoadPeres]
Darkness...[A]
I am being consumed
by darkness...[A]
[0C06]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin, do you know what
this spell tome is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It is probably Apocalypse.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apocalypse?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is also known as the
Elder Revelation.[A]
It was used by Bramimond, the most
enigmatic of the Eight Legends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Bramimond...[A]
I've heard the name,
but nothing more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We know not if Bramimond was
man or woman, young or old.[A]
Nothing specific is written.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's unusual...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]Roy, is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I was just thinking.[A]
[OpenLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There always seem to be traps
where legendary weapons lie.[A]
[OpenLeft]...Perhaps they are meant to keep
the unworthy from wielding them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe so...
But the traps are so intricate.[A]
I feel there must be something
more to them than that.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]
...I have wondered the same thing.[A]
I shall see if there is any
information on the subject.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Thank you.[A]
