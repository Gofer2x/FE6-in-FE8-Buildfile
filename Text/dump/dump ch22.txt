[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What you're saying, then...
is that Murdock is dead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...I am sorry,
Your Majesty.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What is the Etrurian
Army's next move?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They have captured the Shrine of Seals.
They march this way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well...[A]
Then we face them
in the castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes, my king.
My life is yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
No. You cannot die here,
Brunnya.[A]
I have a task of grave
importance for you.[A][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Idunn!
Where are you, Idunn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][NormalPrint]...Here, Your Highness.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
I will remain here and defend the
castle against the Etrurian Army.[A]
You must escape to safety and stay
hidden until the battle is over.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]As Your Highness wills.[A][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Brunnya, you will
guard Idunn.[A]
Protect her as you
would protect me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
No, Your Majesty!
Please![A]
Allow me to fight
by your side![A]
[OpenMidRight]That is something I
cannot do.[A]
...This will be a harsh battle,
and Idunn must survive.[A]
If she is lost...this entire
struggle has been for nothing.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]I must object, Your Majesty!
I serve you and you alone...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Enough, Brunnya!
Your king orders you.[A]
The punishment for
defiance is execution.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes...Your Majesty...[A][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
Idunn, if I fall...[A]
The plan continues.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]As you will...[A]
The world will be liberated
as per Your Highness's command.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good. Then my dream
will be fulfilled.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Of course, Your Highness.[A]
[01C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]The Etrurian Army...[A]
I will not let you into
the throne room![A]
[01C5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][ToggleSmile]I shall protect this
switch with my life![A]
[01C6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[ToggleSmile][FastPrint]This is the king's castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][CloseSpeechFast]
Lord Roy, Zephiel is in the throne
room in the center of the castle.[A]
However, the entryway to the throne
is blocked off by automatic defenses.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What can be done?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
One of the captives said that
at either end of the castle,[A]
there are some switches that can
be manipulated to open the way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That will be a long detour...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There is more.[A]
After hitting the switches,[A]
one must hold the Fire Emblem in front
of the throne room to make it open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have the Fire Emblem with me.[A][Clear]
It sounds like I should go to the throne
room while others handle the switches...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That would be the quickest way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...But would a captive leak that
kind of information so easily?[A]
Perhaps it's a trap...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't believe so.[A]
The captive said the switches are
protected by Bern's ablest warriors.[A]
Even with this information, it will
be no easy feat.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The enemy may be powerful, but we're
not exactly slouches, either.[A]
I know we're up for the challenge!
Victory will be ours![A]
[01C7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
Castle Bern... A worthy target
for the Master Thief.[A]
I'm sure there's mountains of
gold hidden in here somewhere![A]
[01C8]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[ToggleSmile]Is this the switch?
Nothing's happening...[A]
[01C9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentCharacter]
[ToggleSmile]Is this the switch?
Nothing's happening...[A]
[01CA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZephiel][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've come.[A]
Hmph... It's laughable, really.
A mere child making it so far.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Zephiel...
King of Bern...[A]
[MoveRight][OpenRight]
Why did you start this war?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I wish to end the
Age of Man.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][NormalPrint]...I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Humans...are filthy and despicable
creatures.[A]
They flock to the promise of power
like hideous, hairless sheep,[A]
and they stab trusted allies
while their backs are turned.[A]
I'm certain you have witnessed as much
even from many who claim to serve me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Jealousy. Hatred. Greed.[A]
Friends and family are driven to murder
one another by these petty emotions.[A]
Such emotions spawn fathers who would
even kill their own brood.[A]
As long as humans control,
as long as humans exist,[A]
this madness will never end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]
But consider what you've done![A]
You've become exactly that
which you despise![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you know how
the Scouring ended?[A]
[OpenRight]The demon dragon was
defeated by Hartmut...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. It was history's greatest mistake.
Mankind should not have won.[A]
Humans perverted this world into an
ordurous cesspool of madness and evil.[A]
All through their illogical and
contemptible emotions![A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]
Mistakes cannot be left uncorrected.[A]
I will liberate the world from the grasp
of man and return it to the dragons.[A]
The slate will be wiped clean.
History will be rewritten.[A]
It is the only way to free the
world from everlasting agony![A]
[OpenRight]Is it true that you
resurrected the demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There is no need to answer that. You
will know for yourself before long.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]You said you intend to give the
world to the dragons.[A]
How would rule by dragons be
any different?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The dragons you have seen are
weapons for battle.[A]
They have no self.[A]
They lack reprehensible emotions
to drive them, unlike humans.[A]
The dragons' rule will be
just and peaceful.[A]
[OpenRight]Such a world can't be
a better alternative![A]
Some humans may commit
terrible atrocities,[A]
but it has always been other
humans who have stopped them![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Your naivety amuses me.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]
You have lost faith in humanity
and in yourself.[A]
I believe in mankind, and I know
that your lunacy must be stopped![A]
[01CB]
[LoadZephiel][ToggleSmile]You shall not bar my path![A]
[01CC]
[LoadZephiel][ToggleSmile]...I am defeated...[A][Clear]
But remember this...[A]
My will shall never die...[A]
As long as humans retain
control, madness will reign...[A]
[01CD]
[OpenRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Zephiel has fallen...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]We've done it,
Lord Roy.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]...Or have we?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The Dark Priestess is
nowhere to be found...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]...She must have
escaped.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...So it seems.[A]
[01CE]

[01CF]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[.....]
What was that?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Zephiel's sword...
it's glowing![A]
It's...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eckesachs...[A]
A sword that only the
king of Bern can use...[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Lord Roy, legend says that when all
the legendary weapons come together,[A]
the Dragon Sanctuary will rise from
the ground![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]The Dragon Sanctuary...[A]
[OpenFarRight]It was the headquarters
and lair of the dragons...[A]
That's what the legends
say, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
I've heard that, too.[A]
[OpenRight]Does that mean Eckesachs is
the final legendary weapon?[A]
I thought it was the
Binding Blade.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...The Binding Blade may be on an even
higher level than the legendary weapons...[A]
It may be its own entity, beyond compare
to even the legendary weapons...[A]
[OpenRight]More powerful than the legendary weapons...?
What power lies in this sword?[A]
[01D0]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]The sword is glowing again![A]
The light is pointing
to the south![A][SendToBack]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight]
Will the light lead us
to the Dragon Sanctuary?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]
That is how the
stories go.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]
...If the Dark Priestess is the
demon dragon as we suspect...[A]
then she is most likely at
the sanctuary...[A]
[OpenRight]Very well.
We follow the light![A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zephiel...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...
I need some time alone.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Princess...![A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy...
You should leave her be.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin]...An admirable job.[A]
[OpenRight]Elffin![A]
[ToggleSmile]...Thank you.[A]
Your homeland is in turmoil...
yet you chose to help us.[A]
You've been an asset
to us all...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm afraid I don't know what you
mean by my "homeland"...[A]
But it was my greatest pleasure to
assist you.[A]
[OpenRight]I'll never be able
to repay this.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][Clear][.....]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Control by humans...[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Are you thinking of
Zephiel's final words?[A]
He may have been right...
in a way.[A]
[OpenRight]...Has the Dark Priestess
been found?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Unfortunately not...[A]
She apparently disappeared
before the battle.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Is that so...[A]
Do you really think she could
be the demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It is difficult to say
without even seeing her.[A]
It will be near impossible
to locate her now.[A]
She is always clad in a black robe
and none have seen her up close.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's unfortunate... But so be it.[A]
The battle is over.
That's cause enough for celebration.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think not, milord!
The hardest part has yet to come.[A]
The land must be nursed back to
health now that the war is over.[A]
There are countless people in
need of our assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're right!
We have work to do.[A]
The real battle is
only just beginning.[A]
We must look to the future.[A][ToggleSmile]
No matter what hardships we may face,
we must never give up.[A]
We must prove that a land of beauty
and peace from human hands is possible![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
I live to serve you, Lord Roy![A][Clear]
Now, let us make our way home.[A]
We must spread the word of
our victory![A]
