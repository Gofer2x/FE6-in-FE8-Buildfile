[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya]
[ToggleSmile]Sir Jahn, Idunn is here.
I leave her in your care.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
And what about you, human?
What will you do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I will stay here. I will face the
Etrurian Army...and my destiny.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Do you have sufficient troops?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
The wyvern riders scattered around
the continent have returned to us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have any chance
of victory?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...Our chance of victory is
minuscule at best.[A]
But we are the Bern Army, the
strongest force in Elibe.[A]
If nothing else, we shall show
them our unwavering will.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your will...?[A]
You humans are incomprehensible
to us at times.[A]
Do you expect your will alone
to earn you victory?[A]
But so be it.[A]
I leave you to your irrational
pursuit.[A]
[01E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadBrunnya][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Have you given the
troops my message?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, General Brunnya.[A]
I told them they are free
to leave if they so wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]How many remain?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Nearly all of the soldiers say they
still wish to fight for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nearly all of them?[A]
Victory is unlikely.[A]
I'm sure many of the troops have
family awaiting their return.[A]
I do not want any to feel that
they must fight on this day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are knights of Bern, General.[A]
We have no intention of bowing our
heads to Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Dismiss the injured and those with
young children or elderly parents.[A]
They are forbidden from fighting
in this battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]But General Brunnya...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is an order.
Go.[A]
[01EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, the troops
are prepared.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]...Did the messenger return?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, but as expected, the
enemy refuses to surrender.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Was it clear that their safety would
be guaranteed if they surrender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but even given that information,
they apparently politely refused.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why do they fight?
Bern's king is defeated...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadGuinivere][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere...[.....]
Do you understand why?[A]
[OpenLeft]I do very well.[A]
...Bern recognizes itself as
the strongest force in Elibe.[A]
Their pride does not allow them to
accept defeat without a fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint]Lord Roy!
The enemy is advancing![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
...They leave us no choice.
We must fight![A]
Merlinus, send Princess
Guinivere to the back lines...[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]No. I will stay here.[A]
I...must listen to their cries.[A]
That is all I can do to atone
for my betrayal...[A]
[01EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Uncle Karel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir...
Fancy meeting you here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-what are you doing
in a place like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I live here.[A]
After all my travels around the
world, I decided to settle here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Uncle... I must tell
you something.[A]
Mother... She...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Your father told me.[A]
I'm sorry I couldn't
be with you.[A]
I'm sure it must have
been difficult...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[A]
[01ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][ToggleSmile][FastPrint]K-Karel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Bartre?[A]
What are you doing
here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I fight with the Etrurian Army...
What about you, Karel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I live here.[A]
I've traveled enough.
It was time to settle down.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Karel...
I must tell you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]About Karla?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You already know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir told me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I beg your forgiveness!
I could do nothing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't blame you.
It is I who should apologize.[A]
If only I could have been
there with you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[01EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Karel.[A]
I have decided to
assist your army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're the Sword Saint...
Your skills are legendary.[A]
We welcome you.[A]
[01EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager6][OpenMidRight][LoadKarel]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
S-Sir Karel![A]
This place will be
a battlefield...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]
So I see.[A]
I thought I could be free of
war in this isolated land...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What should we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Please don't fret.
I will protect the village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you, Sir Karel![A]
You are truly worthy of the
title of Sword Saint![A]
We have nothing to fear with
you protecting us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I am just an ordinary swordsman.[A]
Stories grow with time, so don't
trust all that you've heard...[A][Clear]
...This war seems to be even
greater than I realized.[A]
I wonder how my sister Karla
fares...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I never knew you had a sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't seen her in years,
but she fell ill some time ago.[A]
I only hope she leads a peaceful
life with her husband and daughter...[A]
[01F0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Fir?
Is that you?[A]
What are you
doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I never expected to find
you here, Uncle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I've traveled enough. I decided it
was time to settle down.[A]
I had hoped to train my sword without
distractions in this quiet village...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uncle...
I must tell you something.[A]
Mother... She...passed on...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...She's gone?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
So she succumbed to
her illness...[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
I wasn't there when you
needed me the most.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]No... It's all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But why are you here?[A]
Surely you haven't been searching
for me just to tell me that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Actually, I'm fighting
against Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You...joined the war?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that you dislike getting
caught up in conflicts like this.[A]
All I wanted was to help the people
who have suffered from this war.[A]
Uncle... Was I wrong? Was I
mistaken in joining this fight?[A]
Should I have found a better way
to train my sword...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, you've made no
mistakes.[A]
A path you choose on your
own is never wrong.[A]
In fact, I think I'll
join you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Absolutely.[A]
...You have grown so
much.[A]
The last time I saw you,
you couldn't even walk yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uncle...[A]
[01F1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][ToggleSmile][FastPrint]Karel?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bartre?
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
I fight with
the Etrurian Army.[A]
I didn't expect to
see you here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]
I've traveled enough. I decided it
was time to settle down.[A]
I had hoped to train my sword without
distractions in this quiet village...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I have something I must
apologize for...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Are you talking about Karla?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...
I did all I could, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]She succumbed to her illness...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Forgive me!
I was too weak to save her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]It is not your fault.
It is I who should apologize to you.[A]
I wasn't at her side when she
needed me the most...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...I wish to ask you a favor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want this battle to end.[A]
I know how you despise warfare...
but will you lend us your skills...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...So that's it.[A]
Very well.
You have my sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, my brother![A]
With your skills,
victory is as good as ours![A]
[01F2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadKarel]
[ToggleSmile]This village has none who
wish to join your fight.[A]
Please leave us in peace.[A]
[01F3]
[LoadBrunnya][ToggleSmile]Bern will never die![A]
Even if I fall, Bern will
rise once more![A]
[01F4]
[LoadBrunnya][ToggleSmile]Your...Majesty...[A]
Let me be...by your side
again...like before...[A]
[01F5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Sanctuary...
The Dark Priestess is in here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Almost assuredly.
But...something is bothering me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What's that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
Legends of the Scouring say the Dragon
Sanctuary has the power of the dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The sanctuary's power is said to
protect the dragons themselves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I believe the dragons in the sanctuary
may be more powerful than those outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you think we still have
a chance against them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Probably, but only with the
legendary weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...It is better to be safe than sorry.[A]
I'll take those of us who can wield
legendary weapons into the sanctuary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Choose wisely.[A]
Once inside, we may be
unable to leave freely...[A]
