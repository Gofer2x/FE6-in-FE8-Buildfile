[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]This is the Dragon Sanctuary...
The air feels strange.[A]
Did the Eight Legends fight
under these conditions, too?[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn]
You humans stand
against us once more.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What...?
Who are you?![A]
When did you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I am Jahn.[A]
I am the last true dragon
of the Dragon Sanctuary.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint]The last true dragon?[A]
You do seem different from
the other dragons...[A]
Are you the demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The "dragons" you have fought
thus far are war dragons.[A]
They know nothing but battle.[A]
The demon dragon too is quite a
different being than I.[A]
I am a pure-blooded dragon who fought
you humans in the distant past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The demon dragon is a
different being?[A]
I thought the demon dragon
was the leader of your kind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The demon dragon is nothing more
than a tool to rally us dragons.[A]
It is hardly what I would call
a leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.....] What exactly is
the demon dragon, then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is much you don't know,
it appears.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What is the demon dragon?[A]
I want to at least know what
it is we are fighting against![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hrmm...[A]
I have no reason to tell you.[A]
But then, I have no reason
not to tell you, either.[A]
What to do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...Very well.[A]
A test. Are you worthy of
hearing the truth?[A]
I await you deep within.[A]
Fight through the hordes of
war dragons and come to me.[A]
Do that, and everything will
be made clear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're deep within?
But you're right here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What you see is an illusion.
A projection.[A]
Come if you wish to know
the truth.[A]
Prove yourself worthy of my time
and I shall tell you all...[A]

[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
Is this really you
this time?[A]
Or...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This is but the beginning.[A]
You have quite a way ahead
of you yet.[A]
But you didn't perish
immediately.[A]
That alone speaks to your
ability.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We have been through
many trials.[A]
We will not die here
and let it be for naught.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you say.[A]
Allow me to tell you a little
bit about the demon dragon.[A]
The demon dragon is not the leader
of the dragons as you thought.[A]
The demon dragon was created to
bring us victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
It was created...?[A]
So it wasn't the demon dragon
who was making dragons...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The "dragons" you speak of are in
fact soulless war dragons.[A]
As I said before, they are different
from pure dragons such as myself.[A]
The war dragons are indeed created
by the demon dragon.[A]
The demon dragon was formed from
a divine dragon,[A]
the most powerful of our kind.[A]
[OpenRight]
It was formed from a
divine dragon?[A]
Did a divine dragon agree to
become the demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Agree? Ha. No.[A]
We destroyed its very soul
to extinguish its will.[A]
It is a mindless drone intended
to heed our every word.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]You what...?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We desperately needed the
power of a divine dragon.[A]
The survival of our entire
species was at stake.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You needed the power of a
divine dragon...[A]
So...you destroyed one's
soul?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you wish to
know more?[A]
Come further.[A]
Show me your
strength...[A]






[01F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not bad. Not bad at all.[A]
I'm curious how far you
will make it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I want to hear more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No matter how many of your kind
we defeated in combat,[A]
you humans continued to multiply
endlessly.[A]
We were eventually overwhelmed
by the sheer number of you humans.[A]
It was then we decided to form a demon
dragon capable of creating war dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
War dragons... Soulless beings
who know nothing but battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Correct.[A]
The divine dragons, however,
were opposed to the idea.[A]
They said it was an affront
to the laws of nature.[A]
As we tried to persuade
the divine dragons,[A]
they suddenly disappeared
without a trace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
They probably chose to leave before
we could take advantage of them.[A]
We never located the majority of
the divine dragon tribe,[A]
but we were able to capture a
single member of their kind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And that became the
demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Precisely.[A]
The divine dragon Idunn was to
become the demon dragon.[A]
It hesitated, however,[A]
as the rift between its tribe
and the rest of us widened.[A]
Hesitation... Such folly
is reserved for you humans.[A]
It serves no end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Her hesitation impeded
your plans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Idunn was immature, but of enough
strength to fulfill our purpose.[A]
Its heart, however, wasn't with us.
It would not follow our commands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
So...that's why you
destroyed her soul...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
We destroyed its soul so that it would
unquestioningly obey our every command.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's...vile...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's enough for now.[A]
Show me more of your power if
you want to hear the rest![A]





[01F9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
You proceed at a good pace.
But you have not won yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rest assured, we
will reach you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your soul is strong.[A][Clear]
What do you wish to
hear next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You created the demon dragon.[A]
The demon dragon had the ability
to create endless war dragons.[A]
Why, then, did you lose to
the humans?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The demon dragon created many war
dragons for use in the battlefield.[A]
The tables were turned.
Our victory was in sight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
However, the humans soon found out
about the demon dragon.[A]
They concluded that their numbers
were not enough to defeat us.[A]
They focused their efforts into forging
weapons that would pierce our scales.[A]
They are what you humans call the
legendary weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That much I know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The strongest human warriors were chosen
to wield their newly crafted weapons.[A]
They came and attacked this sanctuary.[A]
However, the immense power of the
weapons clashing with our own power...[A]
It caused something none of us had
anticipated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The laws of nature started to collapse.[A]
Snow began to fall in summer.
Stars shone in the middle of day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You mean it caused the Ending Winter?[A]
I thought it occurred because the dragons
released vast amounts of energy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that how your legends go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The power of the legendary weapons
was used to restore order to nature.[A]
That's what I learned.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So in other words, we were the cause
of everything bad that happened.[A]
How typical of you humans.[A]
But the truth is as I said.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Then the legendary weapons were sealed
away to prevent another disaster...[A]
The traps that were protecting them
were meant to keep us out...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You humans sealed them away?
An uncharacteristically good decision.[A]
But you seem to be wielding them now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't worry.[A]
The weapons' potency seems to have
decreased since their initial forging.[A]
I doubt they can bring about another
such disaster as they are now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, the warping of nature's laws
dealt a great blow to us dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That disaster was the reason
we lost to the humans...[A]
I shall continue my story when
you advance a bit further...[A]






[01FA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]You have come far.
Perhaps I underestimated you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please continue the story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
When the order of nature collapsed,
we dragons suffered the most.[A]
With nature weakened, we could not
maintain our dragon forms.[A]
And so, we sealed our power into
gemstones and took human form.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The dragonstones...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
We were utterly powerless against
the humans.[A]
In human form, we were even more
feeble than the humans themselves.[A]
The humans took the opportunity
to slaughter us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why did you choose the form of humans?
Why not some other shape?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
In the new order of nature,[A]
the human form required the least
energy to transform into.[A]
The Eight Legends mercilessly crushed us
as we were helpless in our human form.[A]
I too suffered deep wounds.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you hate the humans
because of that attack?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hate? Only humans feel such
preposterous emotions.[A]
We battled for survival
and we lost.[A]
There was nothing more to
our fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
However, we may yet be
victorious.[A]
A human named Zephiel
resurrected the demon dragon.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Then Zephiel really did undo
the demon dragon's seal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is correct.[A]
Show me if you're
worthy to hear more.[A]




[01FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Jahn!
Where are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn]Hm...[A]
I should have expected this of
the man who defeated Zephiel...[A]
You may even have the chance
to fight me personally.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
How did Zephiel know about
the demon dragon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Surely you know that Hartmut of
the Eight Legends founded Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you also know that Hartmut
chose to spare the demon dragon?[A]
Rather than killing it, he
sealed it away.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't
know why.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm... Let me explain.[A]
The Eight Legends defeated our leader,[A]
and made their way into the sanctuary
to find the demon dragon.[A]
However, arriving at its chamber, all
they found was a blank-eyed human girl.[A]
That was Idunn.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]She didn't fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
The demon dragon had its soul destroyed
to follow our leader's commands.[A]
With our leader dead, there were no
commands to follow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then what happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Eight Legends naturally
hesitated.[A]
They had expected to find the
most terrible of all dragons,[A]
but instead they found a
mute girl.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
Knowing the demon dragon still had to be
defeated, they readied their weapons.[A]
Idunn must have reacted to their
attack out of instinct.[A]
It changed into dragon form and fought
as the soulless war dragons do.[A]
Hartmut, however,[A]
brandished a blade even more powerful
than the legendary weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Binding Blade![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know what you humans call it,
but that must be it.[A]
When the blade cut the demon dragon's
flesh,[A]
it fell unconscious rather
than dying.[A]




[01FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJahn][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You have come far.
I am in the next chamber.[A]
It has been ages since I've
shown a human my true form.[A]
I've not left this sanctuary
since the end of the Scouring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y...you've been here
that long?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For one thousand years...[A]
Having survived the Scouring,
I waited, healing my wounds.[A]
I waited for the resurrection
of the demon dragon.[A]
For our chance of victory.[A]
At long last, that time came.[A]
The demon dragon's seal was
broken,[A]
and I felt power flowing
through my veins again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What does the demon dragon's seal
have to do with your strength?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The Dragon Sanctuary's power is
intertwined with the demon dragon's.[A]
With the demon dragon sealed, the
sanctuary, and myself, were crippled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
After I recovered, I sought the
person who had broken the seal.[A]
I used my illusions to seek him
out and ask his intentions.[A]
With you humans ruling the world,
I couldn't go in my true form.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait... I thought that dragons lose
most of their power in human form.[A]
How do you have the power to create
illusions like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This sanctuary is the only place that
dragons maintain some power in human form.[A]
I am also a relatively powerful dragon.[A]
Even in human form, as long as I am in this
sanctuary, illusions are a simple task.[A]
I lack the power to create war dragons
like the demon dragon can, however.[A]
[01FD]
[LoadJahn]I have waited a
millennium...[A]
My strength has recovered,
and it is greater than ever.[A]
I can feel it...[A]
[01FE]
[LoadJahn][ToggleSmile]I fall...[A]
Humans are truly
unpredictable...[A]
[01FF]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]
The demon dragon
lies ahead...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][LoadFae]...Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Fae?[A]
You look like you're
about to cry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Am...am I evil, too...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]When...[A]
When I get older, will I
be a bad dragon, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Slow down, Fae.[A]
Where did you get
that idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That man said that...dragons and
humans can't live in peace...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That wasn't true. You've lived in
Nabata with humans, haven't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But the demon dragon is a
divine dragon like me![A]
You're going to fight the demon
dragon, but what about me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What if...when I grow up...
I'm like the demon dragon...?[A]
Then...you'd have to...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, Fae.[A]
I know you'll never be like
the demon dragon.[A]
You'll always live with
humans. With people like me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Do you really
think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
I want to help the
demon dragon, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Help her?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The demon dragon isn't acting
of her own free will.[A]
She had her soul destroyed.
She is a slave.[A]
I...I don't want to kill
her if I can avoid it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Your words are too big.
I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sure you'll learn what I mean
once you get a little older.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][Clear]
Hartmut posed a question when he
bound the demon dragon.[A]
And I intend to answer it![A]
