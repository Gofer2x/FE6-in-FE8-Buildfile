//Chapter 3
[63]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][FastPrint][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your Majesty, we have
captured the enemy commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Good.
Bring him before me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadHectorBlood]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]You...[A]
You're Zephiel, the king of Bern!![A]
Black-hearted fiend...![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Ah, Lord Hector.[A]
You have my highest praise for lasting so
long against two of my Wyvern Generals.[A]
I suppose Ostia's reputation as the most
powerful house in Lycia is well-earned.[A]
The strongest of a bucket of worms is
hardly a match for my boot, however.[A]
Your end is nigh. If you've any last
words, I suggest you spit them out.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Just tell me...
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What was that?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Bern and Lycia...[A]
We were always on good terms with
each other...[A]
Even when you took the throne, we
always paid our respects to Bern...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Respect?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Pah. Don't make me laugh.[A]
The whole continent shall be my domain.
Only then can the world be liberated.[A]
I lack the time to concern myself with
such trivial matters as "respect."[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You mean to liberate...the world?[A]
What do you speak of...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pay it no heed. You won't
live to see it anyway.[A]
You there![A]
Take him away![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Throw this dead man
into the dungeon![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, Your Majesty![A][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrunnya][CloseSpeechFast]Your Majesty, I will take my leave now.
I must return to the plains of Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, be on your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...One matter before I leave, Your Majesty.[A]
If you will allow my opinion, I would not
place so much trust in that...woman.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Do you speak of Idunn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes, Your Majesty.[A]
The men call her the "Dark Priestess"
and find her presence disturbing.[A]
I understand that she is a shaman
of great power, but--[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Brunnya,
do you doubt my judgment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Ah...! No, of course
not, Your Majesty![A]
I just think--[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Your duty is not to think.[A]
Your duty is to follow orders.[A]
Is that clear?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Yes, Your Majesty.
Your will shall be done.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
"Do you doubt my judgment?"[A]
Dear me, the words that come
out of my mouth sometimes...[A]

[64]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector
still lives?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, probably.[A]
I saw some of Bern's soldiers
take him into the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, was it? Do you know the
inside of Castle Araphen well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess so.[A]
...Wait, are you guys going to
try to save Lord Hector?[A]
Sounds like a bad idea to me.[A]
Most of Bern's forces are gone, but there
are still plenty of soldiers in the castle.[A]
Marching in would be suicide.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps.[A]
But you said most of their
army is already gone.[A]
We can't afford to lose
Lord Hector.[A]
If we have a chance, we
must take it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really, now...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll come with you then.[A]
I can show you around
the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
You don't have to do that.[A]
Please, just explain what the
interior of the castle is like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've got a bone to pick with Bern.
Please, let me go with you![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]If you insist, we're happy to
have you.[A]
I think your skills will be an asset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I can pick any
locked doors or chests![A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...Lord Roy...[A]
I'm sorry for my brother...[A]
I didn't think the invasion
would pick up so quickly...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Princess, you're not
responsible for this.[A]
Please don't blame yourself.
Besides, Lycia is still united.[A]
We just need Lord Hector to lead
our army so we can fight![A][Clear]
We must retake Castle Araphen for all
of Lycia...and for Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's move out![A]

[65]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][LoadPriest][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Thanks for taking the children
under your care, Bishop.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Of course.[A]
The St. Elimine Church will take
good care of the orphans.[A]
And what will you do, Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm going to stay here.
I have some things to take care of.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is that so...?
Please be safe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadVillager14][OpenFarLeft][LoadVillager13][OpenMidRight]Make sure you listen to what
the priest says, OK?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]You're not coming
with us, Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm going to wait for Chad.
We'll catch up with you later...[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Yay!
Chad's coming too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Of course.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I want Raigh
back too![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes...[A]
If Raigh would come back we could
all be together again.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadPriest][CloseSpeechFast]Children,
we must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]
[OpenFarLeft]See you,
Lugh.[A]
[OpenLeft]Don't take too long.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, yes. Hurry along now...[A][Clear]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry for lying...[A]
But I've chosen not to run away anymore.[A]

[66]

[OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Narcian![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenMidRight]What is causing all that noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's left of the enemy are likely
putting up one last fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadIdunnHood][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Shall I summon the dragons,
Your Highness?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNarcian][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]No need, my lady. We can handle them
without so much as breaking a sweat.[A][OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]Not now, Idunn.[A]
Send the dragons back to
Bern as planned.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, Your Highness.
As you will.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadNarcian][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenMidRight][LoadZephiel][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I too must return 
to Bern.[A]
Narcian, I leave Lycia in
your hands.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What shall I do with the remnants
of the Lycian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Kill all who stand
against you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What of women
and children?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Was I unclear? Kill all who
stand against you.[A]
Grind them to dust.[A]
Ensure no others dare dream
of opposing us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Of course, Your Majesty.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[A]

[67]

[OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][OpenMidLeft][LoadSlater][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph, what does His Majesty
see in that Idunn anyway?[A]
Well, I think it's time I
left as well.[A]
Slater, I entrust the
castle to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Might I inquire where
you're going, milord?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A marquess who turned against Lycia
has a special gift for me.[A]
He says it's a girl of Etrurian
nobility...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etrurian nobility?
She must be quite a catch![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes, the marquess tells me she's
a beautiful thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must be looking forward
to it.[A]
Please be careful on your
way there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]You be careful too, Slater. Don't let
these scattered remnants defeat you.[A]
Should you fail, I personally will
order your public evisceration.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Have mercy...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha...![A]

[68]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Chad!
You're OK![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh?!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]We were hiding here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Where's everybody else?
Are they all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, the St. Elimine Church
is going to watch over them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]And what about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Why are you
still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The same reason as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
Lugh, you're not thinking of...![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I can use some magic![A]
Remember I borrowed that fire
tome from Poppa's room?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh, you can't. You're
incapable of harming others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Poppa.
You stay with the others, Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not going to hide anymore![A]
I'm tired of everyone
leaving me...![A]
Poppa, you, and even Raigh...[A]
I want to fight to protect the people
that I care for.[A]
I can't let others die for me my
whole life![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A][Clear]
Fine. Once we finish Bern we can
go back and see everyone again![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yeah![A]

[69]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Chad!
You're OK![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh?!
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]We were hiding here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Where's everybody else?
Are they all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, the St. Elimine Church
is going to watch over them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]And what about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Why are you
still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...The same reason as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
Lugh, you're not thinking of...![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I can use some magic![A]
Remember I borrowed that fire
tome from Poppa's room?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh, you can't. You're
incapable of harming others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I'm going to avenge Poppa.
You stay with the others, Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not going to hide anymore![A]
I'm tired of everyone
leaving me...![A]
Poppa, you, and even Raigh...[A]
I want to fight to protect the people
that I care for.[A]
I can't let others die for me my
whole life![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A][Clear]
Fine. Once we finish Bern we can
go back and see everyone again![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yeah![A]
[6A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Excuse me!
You're with the Lycian Army, right?[A]
Please, let me fight with you![A]
I don't have any useful information,
but I can use a bit of magic![A]
I'm sure I can help you![A]

[6B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're what's left of the
Lycian Army, aren't you?[A]
Here, take this and go quickly.[A]
We may be occupied by Bern, but
we're still Lycians![A]

[6C]

[LoadSlater][ToggleSmile]I-I can't fail!
If I do...[A]
...What awaits me...is a
fate worse than death...!![A]

[6D]

[LoadSlater][ToggleSmile]General Narcian...
Please...have mercy...!![A] 

[6E]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
We found Lord Hector
in the dungeon![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]You did?!
Is he all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]He's gravely wounded...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHectorBlood][NormalPrint]Well met, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][FastPrint]Lord Hector![A]
That gaping wound...![A]
We must get you help!
Here, lean on my shoulder...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry yourself...
I'm done for...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]We were taken by surprise...[A]
We'd have never supposed that Bern
had summoned dragons...![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Dragons?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes...[A]
The same dragons that humans fought
against in the Scouring...[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]The Scouring?
I learned of that in my studies.[A]
Eons ago, dragon and human each had
dominion of half of Elibe.[A]
The Scouring was a war for total
control of the continent...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Very good, lad...[A]
The Eight Legends...defeated the dragons
and led the humans to...victory...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]How did Bern summon dragons...?[A][OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I...haven't the faintest...[A]
But...Bern was once the
dragons' domain...[A]
Hartmut, one of the Eight Legends...
was the founder of Bern...[A]
Perhaps...the reason...lies
there...[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Hector![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Roy... Go to Ostia...[A]
You must...lead what remains of
the Lycian Army...in my place...[A]
[OpenRight]Me...? But...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Fear not...in Ostia...is a weapon...
that...can take down a dragon...[A]
[OpenRight]A weapon?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina can tell you more...
Please take care of her...[A]
She...may act strong...
But she is still a child...[A]
Please...don't let...her...d...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]...I promise you,
I won't.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Lilina... Let me...see you...
just...once more...[A][Clear]
Hrk...!![A][Clear][ToggleMouthMove]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]Lord Hector![A]
