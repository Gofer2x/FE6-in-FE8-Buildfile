//Chapter 4

[6F]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadErik][OpenMidRight][LoadNarcian][OpenMidLeft]Ah, welcome,
General Narcian.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Erik.[A]
I don't think I've yet praised your
wisdom in joining Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you. My nation has never been
anything but a burden to me anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You, my friend, are wise
beyond your years.[A]
Now, where is that gift
you promised me?[A]
She does not seem to be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes!
She is in her quarters.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She is exceedingly naive, you see.[A]
When I told her she could meet her brother,
she cooperated without question.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You there!
Bring her here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenFarLeft][LoadClarine]What is this hall?
Klein? Where are you, Brother?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Welcome, Lady Clarine.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Narcian, one of Bern's
three Wyvern Generals.[A]
My lovely little lass, I think you will enjoy
my company more than your brother's...[A]
[MoveRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hm[.....] hm[.....] hm...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][NormalPrint]Heh...
Ha ha ha![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Why do you laugh?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You compare yourself to my brother?[A]
You think too highly of yourself.[A]
Your garb, your hair--even your speech...[A]
All a painfully obvious guise to hide
your true lowborn face.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Lowborn?! Me?!
You would compare ME to a peasant?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, heavens no.[A]
I would sooner compare you to a
filthy, disease-ridden mutt![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Y-you vermin!![A]
I'll see you
suffer![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadSoldier2]General Narcian, we just received word that
Castle Araphen was retaken by the enemy![A]
[OpenRight]What?! Impossible!
What of Slater?[A]
[OpenLeft]Err...
His whereabouts are unknown, sir.[A]
The enemy is reported to be Roy,
son of Marquess Pherae.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadClarine][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseSpeechFast]Accursed interruptions![A]
Lord Erik, lock the girl in a cell.[A]
I will give her the pleasure of
my company when I return![A]
You, blockade the highroad
from Ostia.[A]
This Roy might just pass by.
I want his head![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, sir![A]

[70]

[OpenMidRight][LoadScollan][NormalPrint]Heh... Foolish nobility. Always
involved in some petty dispute.[A]
'Course, you'll hear no complaints from us.
Turmoil's how we make a living.[A]
Heh heh heh...[A]

[71]

[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]They will pay dearly
for this treatment...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who's there?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][CloseSpeechFast]I'm a mercenary hired by Lord Erik.[A]
He wants to see you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]I will not.[A]
I refuse to meet with
such churlish people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Just get over here.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Let go! You will regret this!
Have you any idea who I am?![A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove]Let go, I say![A]

[72]

[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Let go!
Let go, I say![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Keep it down.[A]
You won't be able to make a clean
escape making all that noise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Escape?![.....]
Then you're...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I prepared a horse for you
out back under a tree.[A]
Take it and go, while
everyone's distracted.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why are you helping me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]I despise Bern with
all my soul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]With all your soul?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Never mind.
Forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]
Saying that only piques
my curiosity further.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Time is short.
Hurry![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[73]

[LoadRutger][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[74]

[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][ToggleSmile]I've never met such a boorish man!
This is a battlefield![A]
A proper gentleman would escort
a lady to her mansion![A]
Well, it's hardly of concern now.[A]
Sigh, I only came here to see my brother,
and now look at the mess I'm in...[A]
What am I to do now?[A]

[75]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadErik][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah,
there you are![A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We need some backup.[A]
Take some troops and
prepare for battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you deaf?
Go and fight![A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard you.
I'll leave when I'm ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Tsk. Not the amiable sort, is he?[A]
If his sword arm is as skilled as the rumors
say, though, then it's no matter.[A]

[76]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarine][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Pardon me,
you there![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you see anyone else?[A]
You are the leader of this
little group, are you not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Most convenient.[A]
Very well then. You
will protect me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Hard of hearing?[A]
I said that you will
protect me from harm.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]Mind your mouth,
young lady![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Away with you, peasant.
I was not addressing you.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]What?!
Who do you think--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint]Calm yourself, Merlinus...[A]
It looks like she's being pursued
by the castle's soldiers.[A]
That's why she wants us to
guard her.[A]
Right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, yes![A]
That is correct...[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMerlinus]
Im...impudent child![A]
We can't simply accept any
useless girl into our army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]You may call me
Lady Clarine, peasant.[A]
And I am not useless![A]
I can use staves to heal
wounded allies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadRoy][FastPrint]So you'll help us fight?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...If that's what it takes![A]
I suppose I can't simply demand protection
without any kind of payment.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, we appreciate it![A]
Our enemy is Bern, so we need
everyone we can get.[A]
I'm Roy.
Pleased to meet you, Lady Clarine.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]The pleasure is all--[A]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ahem! Let's focus on
the issue at hand.[A]

[77]

[OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh!
It's you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
You're still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][CloseSpeechFast]"Still here?"[A]
You abandoned me in the middle
of a battlefield![A]
How can you have the
nerve to say that?![A]
I could have been killed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess you're lucky
you're still alive then.[A]
Did you want something or
can I go now?[A]
[OpenRight]Just a moment![A]
I shan't allow you to abandon
me twice.[A]
A gentleman must take
responsibility for his actions.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Responsibility? For what? I saved
you from that twisted sadist.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]If a gentleman rescues a lady, he must
also escort her to her mansion![A]
In what fairy tale does some barf
of a man abandon his princess?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...What in the world
are you on about?[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Besides, you said you "despise
Bern with all your soul."[A]
If you ask me, you'd be better off joining
us. We'll be fighting Bern, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What? Wait!
Is that true?[A]
Is that army you're in really
going to challenge Bern?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Yes... Our leader, Floyd or whatever
his name is, told me so himself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I'll join your army.
Satisfied?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ah...I suppose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
My protection is more important
than fighting Bern! Come back![A]

[78]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager13]
Without a thief, you can't open
doors and chests so easily.[A]
Only thieves can use lockpicks.[A]
But I have something called a door
key, which will open any door.[A]
Anyone can use it.
You can have it.[A]

[79]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4][ToggleSmile]We're all on your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're not about to abandon the
land in which we were born.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please take this sword.[A]
It was given to us generations ago.
A gift from the marquess.[A]

[7A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe this war is happening...[A]
We'll all suffer under Bern's
iron-fisted rule.[A]
But you just might be able
to stop them.[A]
Here is something that will help
you fight a little longer.[A]
Think carefully before using it.[A]

[7B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]Bandits and pirates will
attack nearby towns.[A]
Once they loot a town,
there's nothing left.[A]
Visit the towns quickly and they
might just share something good![A]

[7C]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager11]There are mounted soldiers
with bows in Laus' army.[A]
They're from the nomad clans
of Sacae.[A]
Everyone wants their fighting
prowess these days...[A]

[7D]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager8]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You know the weapon triangle, but did you
know it doesn't apply to all weapons?[A]
Some weapons completely reverse
the weapon triangle.[A]
For instance, you might find an axe that
will work well against swords.[A]

[7E]

[LoadErik][ToggleSmile]You fools are bound down
by your allegiance![A]
Allow me to teach you
the way of the world![A]

[7F]

[LoadErik][ToggleSmile]Ha...ha ha... Fools...
There is no future for...[A]
those...who oppose...
absolute power...[A]

[80]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy! The remaining
soldiers from Laus are retreating.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.
Tell everyone to get some rest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milord.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][.....][LoadGuinivere]Roy...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I never would have thought that
Lord Erik would turn on Lycia.[A]
I thought the Lycian League's
bond was stronger than this.[A]
Cowardly Bern!
Underhanded tactics![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I'm sorry.[A]
I wasn't even thinking
about you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No... You are right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We'll now proceed west towards Ostia.[A]
But now we know that even the other
marquesses can't be trusted.[A]
With Lord Hector gone, I fear there
may be no peaceful end for this war.[A]
Princess, do you plan on returning
to Bern? If you need anything--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, please allow me to stay,
if it would not be a burden.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You, a burden? Never!
But why do you wish to stay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My brother is wrong.[A]
He is pulling the dragons
into a human war.[A]
If he thinks this is how he can
free the world, I must stop him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Free the world?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, he has always been obsessed
with "liberating the world."[A]
He said that's the purpose
of this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know...[A]
My brother is not so power-hungry that
he would attempt to conquer the world.[A]
I'm sure he believes strongly in
what he's done to Elibe.[A]
Regardless, that doesn't excuse
the violence he has caused...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere...[A]
