[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadDory][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Boss![A]
Our boys just got back from
scouting the village.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Then let's go get
our tribute.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Boss, something's
different today.[A]
There's an army stationed
real close to us![A]
They say it looks like
the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lycia? Then there's
nothing to worry about.[A]
They were almost wiped
out by Bern.[A]
We can handle a few
battered soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right, Boss![A]
[OpenMidRight]They've probably got some
valuables on them too![A]
Still, don't get careless.[A][Clear]
Ready then? Let's mop up
these losers, boys![A]

[82]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]A villager is here to see you,
Lord Roy.[A]
Hey, you, wait just a second...[A][......]
[OpenLeft][LoadVillager2][FastPrint]Are you Lord Roy of
House Pherae?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes.
How may I help you?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]Milord, I beg you![A]
Please, rid us of the bandits
terrorizing our village![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Bandits?[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint]There's a group of bandits that made their
base in the castle near the cliffs.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where are the castle guards?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]They fled once they heard that the
Lycian Army was defeated by Bern...[A]
We villagers were left on our own.[A]
Our days are spent in fear of
bandit attacks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]We have no one else we can ask.
Please, help us![A]
[OpenFarLeft][SendToBack][NormalPrint]Lord Roy, we must keep
our pace towards Ostia...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.[A]
But we can't simply ignore
people in need of help![A]
[OpenFarLeft]You're joking![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]You will help us?!
Thank you![A]
Please use the gate
to the west.[A]
It'll take you right
to the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenLeft]I'll arrange for the gate to be
opened when you approach.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Merlinus! We're going to the
castle to drive off the bandits![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]Sigh... Youthful energy.
Where does it come from?[A]

[83]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Dorothy. Please tell
Brother Saul as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will, Father Yoder.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But where did Saul run off to now?[A]
How am I supposed to guard him
if he keeps disappearing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadVillager5][OpenRight][LoadSaul][OpenLeft][FastPrint]Er... Brother Saul, I appreciate
the offer, but not tonight...[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Come now, don't be like that.[A]
We can sit by the fire in the dark of night
as I soothe you with my calming sermons...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDorothy][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]There you are!
Saul![A]
[OpenRight]Wonderful.
Dorothy...[A]
[OpenLeft][SendToBack]I'll take my leave now.[A][ClearFace][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]No, don't go![A][Clear]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh my... Look what you've
done now, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]That expression on your face
scared her away.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This is my normal look![A]
Saul, you can't try to woo
every girl you meet.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]You make it sound like a bad thing![A]
I simply offer my helping hand
to any poor souls in need.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why do you always offer
to give your sermons at night?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...Well, putting that aside...[A]
Did you have some reason for
interrupting my good work?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, right.[A]
The Lycian Army is apparently
somewhere around here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Truly?! Is Princess Guinivere
still with them?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes, if the reports from the
St. Elimine Church are accurate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then we must make haste!
Let us join them.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What's the matter,
Dorothy?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You only want to join them because Princess
Guinivere is said to be so beautiful.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous...
Come now, hurry along.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, let's go![A]

[84]

[OpenMidRight][LoadVillager9]Oh, I heard you were coming.
I'll open the gate now.[A]

[85]

[OpenMidRight][LoadDory][ToggleSmile]What?
There was a gate there?[A]
Cunning little
weaklings...[A]

[86]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager7]
[OpenMidRight]Hold on. Before you go,
take this lance with you.[A]
It was once wielded by a
knight called Sir Gant.[A]
The stories say he bested many
a foe with this lance![A]

[87]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager8]
If you can, try to occupy forts![A]
That'll stop enemy reinforcements
from showing up![A]

[88]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager12]
[OpenMidRight]I was there when
Araphen was taken...[A]
The wyvern riders of Bern were
terrifying enough...[A]
But then a dragon engulfed the
Lycian Army in flame...[A]
Oh Elimine, please tell me
it was a dream...[A]

[89]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This whole area is really perfect for
bandits. It's no wonder they appeared.[A]
They can cross mountains and a bandit on
a peak is a force to be reckoned with.[A]
Dreadful. Just dreadful...[A]

[8A]

[LoadDory]No one's ever survived
a blow from my axe![A]
Hey, you. Wanna see why?[A]

[8B]

[LoadDory][ToggleSmile]Gah...![A]
No...I don't wanna...
die...[A]

[8C]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenFarRight][LoadGuinivere][OpenRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
A priest from the St. Elimine Church
wants an audience with you...[A]
and Princess Guinivere![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]He knew that Princess Guinivere
was with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Yes. I can't imagine how.[A]
[OpenRight]Me neither...[A]
I'll see him alone.[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy, I will be fine.
I wish to meet this priest.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]Princess?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]Tensions between my brother and the
church have worsened as of late.[A]
I do not believe that they would
attempt anything underhanded.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I see. Merlinus, allow
this priest in.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, it is a pleasure to meet
you at last.[A]
I am Saul, an acolyte of the
St. Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Pleased to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]And you must be Princess Guinivere![A]
You are as beautiful as
the rumors say![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Pardon me...?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ahem... Forgive me.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
Your Highness, I wish to know the
location of the Fire Emblem.[A]
You have it with you,
do you not?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]
[ToggleSmile]How did you know that?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Bern's head church tells us the Fire Emblem
disappeared from the Shrine of Seals.[A]
And you also went missing at exactly the
same time.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I was sent by the church to
confirm the truth.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Why did you take the Fire Emblem?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...I wished to stop my brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your brother...
Zephiel, the king of Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you know what the
Fire Emblem is used for?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]...It's the key that awakens a sword that
was used to slay the dragons long ago.[A]
That was what my father told me anyway.[A]
I am unsure how exactly the Fire
Emblem or the sword work.[A]
My brother seemed to worry about the
Fire Emblem falling into enemy hands.[A]
...Extraordinarily so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you took the Fire Emblem to make the king
believe it fell into enemy hands?[A]
All in an attempt to stop his conquest?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes...but the war continued anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what will you do now?[A]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]...Must I reveal my plan
at this moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Ah, so Your Highness has a plan.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]Yes. I have not given up hope of settling
this war without further bloodshed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
In that case, I will accompany
you on your journey.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]If Roy allows it.[A]
[OpenRight]I have no objections.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere]Thank you, Roy.[A]
[OpenRight]Of course, Princess.[A]
