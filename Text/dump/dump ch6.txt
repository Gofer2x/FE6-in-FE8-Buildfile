//Chapter 6
[8D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]I snuck in here no problem, but
there's nothing worth stealing![A]
Hmm, looks like the north hall has all
the valuables, but with that security--[A][Clear]
...Are those footsteps?[A][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWagner][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I trust everything is under control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Sir Wagner, the soldiers are
stationed all around the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Once they're inside and have their guard
down, ambush them, just as with Lord Orun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want Princess Guinivere alive.[A]
The rest you can do with
as you wish.[A]
Now go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ha ha ha ha...[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]First the Silver Wolf's granddaughter,
and now Princess Guinivere...[A]
With so much to offer, Bern is certain
to allow us to join them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadCath][MoveMidRight]Hmmm...[.....]
Now isn't that interesting.[A]

[8E]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Finally we can get a good
night's rest, Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I wonder.[A]
That man said he was
Lord Orun's advisor...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wagner? Did something
seem wrong with him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He seemed to be in control of
everything, as if he were the lord.[A]
And Lord Orun is so ill he can't
even meet his guests?[A]
It all seems strange...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now that you mention it,
you have a point.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadSaul][CloseSpeechFast]Excuse me, Lord Roy.[A]
There seem to be an awful lot of
soldiers patrolling the castle.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDorothy]I think they're spying on us.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?
No...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadCath][CloseSpeechFast]You noticed?
Not bad.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][NormalPrint]Who's there?!
Show yourself, intruder![A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hi![A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]And...who might you be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Aw, I'm not one to talk about myself.[A]
I overheard that Wagner guy
in the main hall though.[A]
He said they're gonna ambush
you guys.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Lord Orun would never do that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah, he's dead, I think.[A]
Wagner assassinated him
or something.[A]
[OpenRight]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He wants to capture you all
and turn you over to Bern.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadMerlinus][ToggleSmile]Wait, Lord Roy![A]
We can't trust her word
so easily![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's up to you whether you
trust me or not.[A]
But don't say I didn't
warn ya![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadGuinivere][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Roy...
If what she says is true...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's spring his trap.
We'll pretend like we're leaving.[A]
If Wagner is after us, he'll try
to persuade us to stay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you wanna get out,
go through the north hall![A]
That'll bring you to the courtyard,
so you'll be outta here in no time.[A]
Good luck![A]

[8F]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadWagner][OpenFarRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Lord Roy!
Where are you off to?[A]
I will escort you back into the
castle. Please follow me.[A]
[OpenFarRight]My apologies, Sir Wagner.[A]
I have just received a report
of grave importance.[A]
Please excuse us, but we must
take our leave now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Surely you would appreciate a warm bed
after being in the field for so long.[A]
Lord Orun would be furious with me if you
left without accepting our hospitality.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Don't worry, I shall tell Lord Orun
myself that you are not to blame.[A]
I ought to at least offer him
a greeting anyway.[A]
Please show us to his room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As I said, milord, Lord Orun is
ill and cannot accept guests.[A]
[OpenFarRight]If we cannot see him,
then we must be off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][NormalPrint]There's nothing I can offer
to make you stay?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]You leave me no choice then![A]
Guards! Attack![A]
Kill them all, but leave
Princess Guinivere alive![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]The girl was right! They
were trying to ambush us![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul]Lord Roy![A]
If we go this way, we'll be leaving
our rear open to attack![A]
[OpenFarRight]Then we'll seize the whole castle!
Everyone, follow my lead![A]

[90]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCath][FastPrint]Hoo-boy, they're at each
other's throats now.[A]
Time to pilfer what I can now
that security's busy.[A]

[91]

[OpenMidRight][LoadSue][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]All that noise...[A]
A battle?
What is going on out there?[A]

[92]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]What's a girl doing in here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You aren't with the castle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Roy.
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Sue. Are you the one
causing that noise outside?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Noise?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The noise of a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, I guess so.[A]
We're fighting the
castle guards.[A]
It's a bit of
a long story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]I see.
Then I will join your side.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]You will?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]The soldiers of this castle
have wronged me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
What do you mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please give me a bow.
I will fight with you.[A]

[93]

[LoadWagner][ToggleSmile]Useless guards!
But very well.[A]
Witness my magic...and bow
down before its power![A]

[94]

[LoadWagner]
[ToggleSmile]No... My plan...
was flawless...[A]

[95]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]...You're the granddaughter of one
of the chieftains of Sacae?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My grandfather is the strongest
warrior in Sacae.[A]
People call him the
Silver Wolf.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Silver Wolf...
I've heard tales of him.[A]
But what are you doing in Lycia?
This is a long way from Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern invaded Sacae, so the Kutolah
clan decided to take up arms.[A]
Grandfather had the women and
children escape to Lycia, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]But?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]There was a traitor.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]The Djute clan, who turned to
Bern's side, ambushed us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]We were all separated.[A]
I found my way into this land and
I was rescued by Lord Orun.[A]
But Wagner, his advisor, assassinated
Lord Orun and took over the castle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And that's when you
were captured...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Is your army fighting Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we will fight for
as long as it takes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then let me join you.[A]
Fighting Bern may lead
me to Grandfather.[A]
Lord Orun deserves
vengeance as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're headed for Ostia, in the west.[A]
Sacae is in the east, the opposite
direction. Is that all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't mind.[A]
No matter where we are, Mother Earth
and Father Sky watch over me.[A]

[96]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy! The spy I sent to
Ostia has just returned.[A]
He says that Ostia is in
a state of anarchy![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?! Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]There's been a rebellion among those
who want to surrender to Bern.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Is Lilina safe?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The spy says that she has
been taken hostage.[A]
The rebels already took over Castle Ostia
and are fighting the loyalist soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]We must hurry to Ostia!
Lilina... Please be safe![A]
