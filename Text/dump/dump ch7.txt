//Chapter 7
[9A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDebias][OpenMidRight][LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Is everything quiet,
Debias?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, General. The townspeople are
no trouble.[A]
But the Ilian mercenaries that Hector
hired still refuse to join us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What more do they want?
We already said we'd pay more![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia's mercenary knights
are famously loyal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]I know that, you
bloated imbecile![OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][A]
[OpenRight]But General Narcian
will arrive soon![A]
If we don't have Ostia under
our control by then,[A]
he'll never take us
seriously![A]
[OpenFarLeft][FastPrint]Y-yes, General.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]Lilina may make for a valuable
bargaining chip with the mercenaries...[A]
If her life is in danger, they
should surrender.[A]
But that must be a last resort.[A]
First we must attempt to beat them
into submission.[A]
The wyvern riders Bern sent us
should prove invaluable![A]
Debias, I want the mercenaries pacified
and the castle gate secured.[A]
I will be inside the castle readying
our defenses.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][NormalPrint]Yes, General![A]

[9B]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenRight][LoadRoy][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]How many of Ostia's troops
have joined the rebellion?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Quite a large majority,
I'm afraid.[A]
They've forgotten their fealty
to Lord Hector.[A]
They all simply gave in to
Bern because they're afraid.[A]
It's a disgrace, I tell you.[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]Is that so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]But it's not all
bad news, Lord Roy![A]
There's a band of mercenaries from Ilia
that wish to join us to stop the rebels.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][LoadGuinivere]Mercenaries from
Ilia, you say?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh, yes.[A]
They signed a contract with Lord Hector
to fight Bern alongside Ostia.[A]
[OpenRight]They could be a great help.[A]
But do they know Lord Hector
has passed away?[A]
Isn't their contract void
now that he's gone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I would have thought
so, too, Lord Roy.[A]
They told me themselves however that they
heard of Lord Hector's passing.[A]
They're still eager to fight with us.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]They're only mercenaries.
Why would they go so far?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]Ilia is a frozen land with a harsh
climate so the land is very infertile.[A]
And so, mercenary contracts are a major
source of income in Ilia.[A]
Ilian mercenaries are said to never
betray their employers, no matter what.[A]
It seems that's true indeed.[A]

[C9]

[OpenRight][FastPrint]Then they should be
powerful allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I agree! Fortune is
still with us![A][ToggleSmile]
But...the mercenary I spoke to
also had some bad news.[A]
He said one of the three Wyvern Generals is
headed here with a legion of wyvern riders.[A]
Should they aid the rebels, our chance of
victory will be all but gone.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Roy... What are you going to do?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][CloseSpeechFast]...The Kingdom of Etruria
might help us.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][FastPrint]Etruria?!
Is it possible?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]General Cecilia, Mage General of Etruria,
was my teacher in tactics at Ostia.[A]
I feel she may join forces with
us if we ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I object, Lord Roy![A]
If we have Etruria solve this Lycian matter,
our reputation with them will never recover![A]
[OpenRight]That may be so...[A]
But this is a matter of life or death
for Lycia.[A]
We must ask for help, for if we don't, Lycia
as we know it may become just a memory.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenRight]But we must act quickly! I've already
penned a letter to General Cecilia.[A]
Merlinus, I need you to send the
letter to her right away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, Lord Roy!
I trust your judgment.[A]
I shall send it this
instant.[A]
[OpenRight]With any luck, she'll
make it in time.[A][Clear]
Get ready for combat, soldiers!
We will retake Ostia![A]


[9C]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]It looks like the Lycian Army has
commenced a counterattack on the rebels.[A]
Let's join them and quell this
shameful little rebellion![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Wait,
where's Noah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uhhh, I think he went to the
arena a little while ago.[A]
He said he's coaching some
girl in swordplay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Noah, a coach?
That's not like him...[A]
Has he made a little girlfriend,
I wonder? Ha ha.[A]
Well, no matter.
He can catch up with us later.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Time for action.
Move out.[A]

[9D]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Looks like they've started
attacking the rebels.[A]
I need to get going, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Thank you for helping
me, Sir Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
I sure was surprised when you
came up to me though.[A]
Not many people would challenge someone
to a match so quickly like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry, Sir Noah.[A]
I'd never fought in
the arena before...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you'd asked anyone else,
you'd be dead now.[A]
You need to look your opponent over
carefully before choosing a fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And I must have the humility to surrender
if it appears I'll lose.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Exactly.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]You can always get your money back,
but don't throw your life away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]You're right!
Thank you![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]What will you do now?[A]
Will you stay here and continue
practicing the sword?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I'm going to the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Western Isles?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They're constructing a new mine, so there
are many new workers headed there.[A]
Miners are strong, so it's no doubt an ideal
place to find new opponents to challenge.[A]
And besides...[A][OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The Western Isles is where my
mother first met my father.[A]
She's passed on, but at my age she traveled
around the world training herself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]So that's it...
You surprise me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I thought all you wanted was
to become strong.[A]
I didn't realize you were following
in your mother's footsteps.[A]
You do have a cute side after all![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sir Noah!
Please don't tease me![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Ha ha ha ha![A]

[9E]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDebias][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The reinforcements should be
arriving from the south soon.[A]
Heh heh... I want to see the look on their
faces when they get hit from behind![A]

[9F]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][FastPrint][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, are you Sir Zelot of
the Ilian mercenaries?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]That's me.
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I lead the army that's
fighting the rebels.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...
I expected someone older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm here because Lord Hector
asked me to be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a great man.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have to retake Ostia.
For Lord Hector![A]
And for Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I concur.[A]
We'll offer what
help we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for
the assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Save the thanks for after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come! We must concentrate
on the enemy now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Right![A]

[A0]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you one of the
Ilian mercenaries?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure am.
Can I help you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh! I heard about you...[A]
I'm supposed to take orders
from you now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you sure
that's all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Don't you have to check in
with your commander...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]He told us we're joining the
Lycian Army. That's enough for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But did he mean like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]This is a battlefield.[A]
There's no time to check
everything with the commander.[A]
As long as I'm following orders, and
I am, I can play it by ear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I see.
Thanks for the help.[A]

[A1]

[OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][NormalPrint]Noah![OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot.
Sorry I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I heard you were coaching a
girl in swordplay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
She was inexperienced and naive,
so I felt obligated.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]She isn't with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]She left. She said she was
heading for the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pity. I thought she might have been of
some help were she still here.[A]
But you, a coach? Since when do you
care about other people?[A]
It's very unlike you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Do you think so, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Oh, yes.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I even joked with Trec saying
that you fancied the lass.[A]
But THAT wouldn't be like you
in the least, now would it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[A2]

[OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Trec, we're now in service
to the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]OK, I guess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not the most enthusiastic
response. You don't like the idea?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wha?
No, it's fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, well, all right then.
Get to it then.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Lycia, huh...?
Eh, it should all work out.[A]

[A3]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you one of the
Ilian mercenaries?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Hmmm?
Yeah, I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.
I lead the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'll take your orders
from now on then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]What?
Just like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You don't have to check in
with your commander first?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Oh. Nah.[A]
He already said we're joining
the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But still...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Really, it's fine.
This is a battle.[A]
There's no time to check every
little thing with the commander.[A]
It's not as though I'm going
against his orders anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...All right.[A]

[A4]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
I heard you were
at the arena.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,
sorry I'm late.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry yourself...
Things are just getting started.[A]
I haven't even spoken with the
Lycian Army's commander yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Actually, I just spoke
to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
Then we'll take any commands
he gives from now on.[A]
Noah, I leave further negotiations
with the Lycian League to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]

[A5]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Trec.
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just met with the commander
of the Lycian Army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, did you?[A]
Then we'll take any commands
he gives from now on.[A]
Trec, I leave further negotiations
with the Lycian League to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]

[A6]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][FastPrint][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me, are you Sir Zelot of
the Ilian mercenaries?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]That's me.
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]My name is Roy.[A]
I lead the army that's
fighting the rebels.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]You?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Impressive...
I expected someone older.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm here because Lord Hector
asked me to be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...
We've lost a great man.[A]
He was a true warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We have to retake Ostia.
For Lord Hector![A]
And for Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I concur.[A]
We'll offer what
help we can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you for the
assistance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Save the thanks for after
we've retaken the castle.[A]
Come! We must concentrate
on the enemy now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Right![A]

[A7]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]Look at this great
bow I made.[A]
It fires arrows much farther
than a normal bow![A]
Very useful, don't you think?
Of course you do.[A]
You can have it.
I want it to go to good use.[A]

[A8]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager6]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, this? This is a torch staff.
It creates light in foggy places.[A]
If you're in fog, you can't
attack anything you can't see.[A]
This should be helpful if you ever
find yourself in that situation.[A]

[A9]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
[OpenMidRight]Would you like to buy some elixir?
It'll patch your wounds right up![A]
The recipe is top secret...
Don't ask, because I'm not telling![A]
What's that?
You don't want any?[A]
Here, I'll give you a free sample!
You won't be disappointed.[A]

[AA]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager5]
[ToggleSmile]Ostia is Lycia's greatest city!
But now look at it...[A]
What did you say? You're out
to restore our former glory?[A]
Then please,
take this gem...[A]
It'll fetch a high price
at any store![A]
Just use the money
to help Ostia![A]

[AB]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager14]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you going to help Lady Lilina?[A]
Here's a staff that can heal
injuries from a distance![A]
If Lady Lilina's hurt,
please heal her...[A]

[AC]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager4]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A while back, I saw a man
dying in the street.[A]
I helped him out, and he gave
me this sword.[A]
Really strange person, but kind...
Hm? This is the sword.[A]
You can have it!
Take good care of it.[A]

[AD]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]General Legance has allied
himself with Bern![A]
He had all who resisted him
killed... I escaped, though.[A]
Please take this. It's a
Hero crest.[A]
Give this to an experienced hero,
and fight to save Ostia...[A]

[AE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager3]
Cavaliers, paladins...
Mounted knights like those.[A]
This lance is incredibly effective
against such soldiers.[A]
There are many horsemen in the rebel
army, so use this against them![A]

[AF]

[LoadDebias][ToggleSmile]You...you beat Bern's
wyvern riders!?[A]
Ergh...
I'll not let you pass![A]

[B0]

[LoadDebias][ToggleSmile]General Legance...
Please be cautious...[A]
These people are...
powerful...[A]

[B1]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]The city is finally
under control.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]Now let us retake Castle Ostia
and rescue Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus]Lord Roy, I understand your
apprehension, but please be patient![A]
We still need to break down
the castle gate.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]...Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Speaking of Lady Lilina...[A]
What do you think of what
Lord Hector said?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You mean about the dragons?[A]
They were real, not just myth...[A]
Lord Hector was one of the
greatest tacticians in Lycia.[A]
And yet his army was defeated in
the blink of an eye...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's army is perhaps the
strongest in Elibe.[A]
I say, those wyvern riders were
indeed very formidable opponents.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course the wyvern riders must
have been difficult enough.[A]
But the dragons... I can't even
conceive how powerful they must be.[A]
Lord Hector mentioned a weapon that
is effective against dragons...[A]
I wonder where it's hidden.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume it must be one of
the legendary weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If we can obtain those, we might have a
fighting chance against the dragons.[A]
But I do wonder what a legendary
weapon is doing in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps Lady Lilina knows
the answer. I'm curious as well.[A]
Oh![A]
Lord Roy, our men have finished
knocking down the gate.[A]
We can enter now![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]All right! Forward charge![A]
Rescue Lilina, no matter
the cost![A]
