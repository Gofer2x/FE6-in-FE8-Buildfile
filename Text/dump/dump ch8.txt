[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]
[MoveMidRight]The enemy has broken
into the castle?![A]
How could Debias have
failed against them?![A]
Were those Ilian mercenaries
that skilled?[A]
...Or was the Lycian Army larger
than we expected...?[A]
Whatever the case, they have broken into
the impregnable Castle Ostia![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]We must defeat them here, or we'll
be a laughing stock in Bern...[A][Clear]
You over there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]Yes, General![A]
[OpenMidRight]Have the troops take defensive positions
throughout the castle![A]
Particularly around the throne room![A]
We must not allow the Lycian Army
any further into the castle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, General![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]One other matter.[A]
I want you to have Lilina quietly
assassinated during the battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]What? ...I thought we
were to keep her alive.[A]
[OpenRight]I felt she might make
a valuable hostage.[A]
But many of our rebel soldiers
still swear loyalty to her.[A]
If we openly use her as a hostage,
those soldiers may turn.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]If that's the case, General, would they not
also turn if we assassinate her?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]That's why I said to do
it quietly, isn't it?![A]
Kill her discreetly, and say that
she was hit by a stray arrow.[A]
We can hold the enemy responsible!
Now go![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, General...[A]

[B3]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][.....]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAstolfo]...General Roy of Pherae,
I presume.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Who are you?!
An enemy?![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no. I'm on your side.
My name is Astolfo.[A]
I used to work here in the
service of the marquess.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadMerlinus]What kind of work were
you doing exactly?[A]
You certainly aren't dressed
like a servant...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]A bit nosy, don't you
think, old man?[A]
I'm a spy, see.[A]
I gather information, steal things,
check on people... Things like that.[A]
[OpenFarRight]That explains it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm not much of a spy if you can tell I
work for a noble at first glance, am I?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been running around Lycia gathering
intelligence for about a month now.[A]
When I heard about Araphen, I got back
as quickly as my legs would allow.[A]
And what do I find but those muttonheads
Legance and Debias inciting rebellion![A]
I couldn't save Lord Hector, but I
won't let them take Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenRight]Then you'll join us?
Do you know where Lilina is?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Of course. Finding that
stuff out is my job.[A]
Lady Lilina is locked in a small room
in the heart of the castle.[A]
And Legance is sitting on the
throne like he owns the place.[A]
[OpenRight]We have to hurry then.[A]
We must defeat the rebels and save Lilina
before Narcian arrives from Bern![A]

[B4]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's all that noise?
Is there a battle going on?[A]
I wish I could see outside
this chamber...[A]

[B5]

[OpenFarRight][LoadOgier][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Sir Barthe,
it's a dead end![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][CloseSpeechFast]This wall has cracks in it.[A]
We can break it down if we hit
it with our weapons.[A]
[OpenRight][LoadGwendolyn]I wonder where
Lady Lilina is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a pretty good idea
of where she might be.[A]
I've known this castle
for a long time.[A]
I do wonder what's causing
all the noise, though.[A]
[OpenRight]The Lycian Army, perhaps?[A]
My brother must be
with them...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We can't be sure he's
still alive.[A]
You had best keep your
hopes low.[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]Ah...
Yes, you're right.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseSpeechFast]Sir Barthe, must you
be so aloof?[A]
Bors is Gwendolyn's only brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]We must always stand
firmly in reality.[A]
[OpenFarRight][NormalPrint]But--[A]
[OpenRight][FastPrint]It's all right, Ogier.
Sir Barthe is right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]As a knight of Ostia,
you must always remain calm.[A]
It matters not how grave the
situation.[A]
Understood, Gwendolyn?[A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint]...Yes, sir.[A]

[B6]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath]Oh baby![A]
Just as I thought.
They're at it again.[A]
How stupid can these
nobles get?[A]
I'll never understand what fun
it is fighting all the time.[A]
Oh well. I'll take the opportunity
to swipe what I can.[A]

[B7]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][NormalPrint]Lilina![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina]...Roy?[.....]
Is it really you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, it's me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You came!
Thank you so much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm so glad you're unhurt.
Here, take this spell tome.[A]
Use it to defend yourself for
the time being.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thanks.[A]

[B8]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][NormalPrint]Bors!
You're all right![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBors][FastPrint]Is that you, Gwendolyn?[A]
I'm so glad to see
you in one piece.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Wha...!? What...what's
that you're wearing?![A]
Did you join up with
the Ostian knights?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Actually, yes.
I was knighted just yesterday.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What are you thinking...?[A]
I told you to leave the fighting
to me and live as you wish![A]
You didn't need to become
a knight...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I thought about it, and I
realized that this is what I want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I don't want to sit idly by and wait
for you to return from battle.[A]
I want to be a great knight,
just like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]You've always been a
stubborn one, Gwendolyn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Live as you wish.[A]
If Mother and Father were alive,
I'm certain they'd say the same...[A]
But the life of a knight
is never easy![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm prepared!
I'm ready for the challenge![A]

[B9]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
Lady Lilina!
You are unharmed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors, I'm sorry that
I worried you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, milady!
You are well...[A]
That in itself is
enough for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors.[A]
And you kept your promise
to protect Roy.[A]
I knew I could
depend on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, milady![A]

[BA]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBarthe]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina!
I am overjoyed to see you safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Barthe, you were right.
Legance was planning this rebellion.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]
If only I'd trusted your word,
this would not have happened...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
Lady Lilina, you have
nothing to apologize for.[A]
Legance betrayed your
kindness and trust.[A]
He is the one responsible
for this.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It is your undying kindness that we
soldiers respect the most, milady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Barthe...[A]

[BB]

[LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Dogs of the Lycian Army...
Come.[A]
I shall cut you down
where you stand![A]

[BC]

[LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]How? You will only...
be crushed by Bern...[A]
How can you fight with
such conviction...?[A]

[BD]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]We've finally retaken
the castle, Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Roy.[A]
I'm glad that my father didn't have
to go to the trouble.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, is my father still in Araphen?[A]
I heard there was a horrible battle there,
but how much longer will he be?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...
You haven't heard?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heard what?[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Hector...
passed on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry... By the time we arrived
at Castle Araphen...[A]
It was already under Bern's control.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not your fault...
Don't apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Hector had been fatally
wounded when we arrived.[A]
If only we had gotten there sooner,
we could have helped him...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No...
I...was prepared for this...[A]
I'm the daughter of
a warrior.[A]
I've been taught to steel myself
in times such as these.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Everybody kept it from me...
They didn't want to hurt me...[A]
But I'm strong... I can
handle this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina, you don't have
to hold back...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy... I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We'll get through this...
I'm here for you.[A]

[BE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy! Bern's wyvern riders
are in front of Castle Ostia![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]What?!
They're here already?![A]

[BF]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadNarcian][OpenFarRight][LoadRoy][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hm [.....]hm [.....]hm...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You must be Roy.[A]
I thank you for ridding me
of that cretin Legance.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Now, leave Ostia to me and we can all
go home with our limbs attached.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]Never![A]
I'll never hand Ostia over to
the likes of you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oho?[A]
You think you can best us with that
sad little group of yours?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]I will cut you open,
just as I did to Hector![A]
[OpenRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarFarRight]That's enough![A]

[C0]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNarcian][.....]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]General Narcian!
A legion has arrived from Etruria![A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that, you fool!
But why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][FastPrint]I am Perceval,
Knight General of Etruria.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]Mage General Cecilia informed me that the
Lycian Army had requested Etruria's aid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]What...?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]We are prepared for battle.[A]
Can those wyvern riders of yours
stand against our might?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidRight]I am Cecilia,
Mage General of Etruria![A]
Ostia is now under our
protection.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Argh...!
You...you...!!![A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][CloseSpeechFast]General Narcian,
please control your temper![A]
General Perceval is one of the
most skilled knights in Etruria![A]
Combined with General Cecilia,
we haven't a chance![A]
[OpenLeft]I know that!
We're leaving![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]Cecilia, was it?[A]
We'll see who has
the last laugh![A]

[C1]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you General Roy of
the Lycian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, I am![A]
I lead the Lycian Army
in Lord Hector's place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure.[A]
You have my sympathy for the
current turmoil in Lycia.[A]
Our king also sends his
condolences for Lord Hector.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
If you hadn't helped us...Ostia
would be under Bern's control now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.
I simply followed my king's orders.[A]
You should thank Cecilia. She defied the
king until he agreed to help you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]She...
opposed the king?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, she put her neck on the line.[A]
Well, I must be off.[A]
Etruria calls. As one of the three Generals
of Etruria, it requires my presence.[A]
Cecilia,[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
[OpenMidLeft]will you take care of the loose ends?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Thank you, Perceval.
Leave the rest to me.[A]

[C2]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Wow...
General Perceval...[A]
Just his presence was
intimidating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][ToggleSmile]Nervous, were you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How are you, Roy?
You look a little tired.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm fine, thanks to you.
It could have been a calamity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad we made
it in time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry I put you through
so much trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be.[A]
It will benefit Etruria for Ostia
to go under our protection.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Benefit Etruria?
How?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bern's been increasingly
aggressive, as you know.[A]
If Bern gains any further strength, the
balance of power will be shattered.[A]
Still, we haven't been attacked, so
we couldn't simply declare war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So when we requested aid, it was
justification to declare war on Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Precisely.[A]
We only did what is
best for our land.[A]
You needn't feel that
you're in our debt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]If you insist.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Regardless, please come in and
meet the rest of the army.[A]

[C3]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia]...He's grown so much in the short
time since I met him last.[A]
He's maturing into a man.[A]
