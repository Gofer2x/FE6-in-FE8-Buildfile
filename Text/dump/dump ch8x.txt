[OpenMidLeft][LoadBanditKid][OpenMidRight][LoadHenning][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]B-Boss!
An army's in the cave![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
How many of them are there?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dunno, Boss.
Not too many, I hope...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's strange, though...[A]
The lords of Lycia have bigger fish
to fry than bandits like us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well?
What do we do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't expect they know
much about this cave.[A]
Just lure them onto the lava
geysers and get rid of 'em.[A]
[0BD4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, this way![A]
The legendary weapon is on the other
side of this flaming crevice.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]Lilina, are you all right? Have you
already come to terms with everything?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[ToggleSmile]maybe not just yet.
But I can't afford to be in sorrow.[A]
Ostia needs me to protect it, just
as it needed my father before me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm just glad you're
all right, Lilina.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Only because you're
with me, Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Did you just say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.[A]
Let me tell you what I know
about the weapon.[A]
The sword here was used by Roland
himself, one of the Eight Legends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Roland...
The first marquess of Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly. He's my ancestor.[A]
This sword is called Durandal,
the Blazing Blade.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Durandal... The name has a
strange echo to it.[A]
So Roland used Durandal to fight
the dragons during the Scouring?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's how the legend goes.[A]
They also say that after the war ended,
Roland returned to his home of Ostia.[A]
He raised Durandal high above his head,[A]
and the earth scorched by the flames of
war suddenly blossomed with life again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... That sword has
quite the story to it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's a weapon that can defeat dragons,
so it must have some exceptional powers.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh, yes. I heard that a group
of bandits has made its base here.[A]
Will the sword be all right? Might the
bandits have taken Durandal?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no, don't worry
yourself about that.[A]
Only descendants of Roland know how to
remove Durandal from its sheath.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's reassuring.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All that's left then is to rid this cave
of the bandits and take Durandal.[A]
[0BD5]
[LoadHenning][ToggleSmile]Sigh.[A]
How did you find
yourselves in here?[A]
I'm afraid I can't
let you go.[A]
[0BD6]
[LoadHenning][ToggleSmile]Ah, blast...[A]
I knew this would happen...[A]
[0BD7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][ToggleSmile]Roy!
Here it is![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]So this is Durandal...
It's enormous.[A]
I don't think many of us will
be able to swing it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]History has it that Roland
was a small man.[A]
Any fighter skilled enough should be
able to wield the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then if I become better with the
sword, I could use it as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well... I don't
know about that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, come now.[A]
Have SOME confidence
in me, at least![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hee hee![A]
[0BD8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy, we have it!
It was under the altar.[A]
It was no simple task to get it out,
but it's in our possession now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]This is Durandal...[A]
But was it worth
Lilina's life...?[A]
