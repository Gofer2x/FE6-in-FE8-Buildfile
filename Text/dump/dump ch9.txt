//Chapter 9
[C7]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan][OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Boss! The Lycians
are here![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Oh yeah. We just saw 'em dock at
that little island in the east.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Good. They're probably floundering
about in this thick fog.[A]
Sneak up from where they can't
see and finish 'em.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, Boss.[A]

[C8]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, I'm sorry that
I couldn't stop this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It isn't your responsibility, General
Cecilia. Don't concern yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even in Etruria people dislike how the high
chancellor treats the Lycians as pawns.[A]
[OpenMidRight]High chancellor? I thought the king
made the decision to send us here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Actually, he didn't. High Chancellor Roartz
works closely with Lord Arcardo,[A]
the noble who heads the mining operations
here in the Western Isles.[A]
They made the decision without
consulting the king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They have that power?[A]
How?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Did you hear of the tragedy that
occurred in Etruria last year?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
Prince Myrddin, next in line to be king,
abruptly passed away last year.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never had the honor to
make his acquaintance.[A]
I understand that he was a very
bright individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... Were the prince alive, Etruria
would surely not be in this sad shape.[A]
King Mordred was overcome with sorrow
when his son departed.[A]
The shock was so great that he has
yet to recover.[A]
Of late, it seems he's always detached
from reality.[A]
He pays no mind to anything happening
around him or in the kingdom.[A][Clear]
Roartz is exploiting the king's
condition for his own benefit.[A]
Now, he's essentially in charge
of the goings-on in the palace.[A]
He keeps the three Etrurian Generals,
Perceval, Douglas, and myself,[A]
away from the king except in times
of great urgency.[A]



[CA]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But what about when you came
to our aid in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That was an exception because
I had Perceval behind me.[A]
But I'm sorry, I didn't have
the clout to prevent this...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't blame you.[A]
We will return to Lycia as soon as
we complete our mission here.[A]
But please, I only ask that you take
care of Lycia in our absence.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You needn't ask.[A]
The Lycian League is in safe hands,
as is Princess Guinivere.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere]Roy...
May I not go with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The battles on these islands
are likely to be ugly.[A]
I can't predict what might
happen.[A]
You should stay in hiding in Etruria
with General Cecilia's protection.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenLeft][LoadCecilia]You can trust me, Your Highness.[A]
I know you want a truce to end
this war.[A]
I will defend you no
matter the cost.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]...I understand.
I'm truly sorry to trouble you.[A]
Roy, I pray for your safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Your Highness.
I will pray for yours as well.[A]

[CB]

[OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Scott![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Oh, Fir.
Sorry to call you in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]What's going on out there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The island is under
attack by pirates.[A]
They've come to kill the
people living here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][FastPrint]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I sent some guys over to try and stop
them, but the pirates are very skilled.[A]
The outlook isn't good.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]I can't believe it...[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'd like to fight them myself,
but I can't leave this castle.[A]
Fir, I'm sorry, but can
you go in my place?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Yes. I will go and purge the
people of these pirates.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Yeah, thanks.[A]
[OpenLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Leave them to my blade![A]
Anyone who attacks innocent villagers
will get no mercy from me![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I have someone you
can work with too.[A]
[OpenLeft][NormalPrint]You do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Yeah. He's a nomad named Sin.[A]
He's a little skinny, but he's
a decent shot with his bow.[A]

[CC]

[OpenMidRight][LoadScott]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan][ToggleSmile]Boss, you sure? I mean, that
girl won't have any chance...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know what I'm doing.[A]
Once she's killed, we can take
that sword she's carrying.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The sword?
That weird one she has?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not just any weird sword. It's a
Wo Dao, a famous blade from the east.[A]
It's worth a fortune. Heh heh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ohhh, I get it now.[A]
[CloseSpeechFast]That's why you were so
hospitable to her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't do anything before,
but now's our chance.[A]
I want you to follow her.[A]
Once she's finished, take the sword
from her lifeless hands![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Sure thing, Boss![A]

[CD]

[OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Are you...
Sin?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Yes.[A]
I heard everything from Scott.
Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]So, uh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Uh, are you here to
protect the villagers like me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I have no interest
in such things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I'm paid to fight.[.....]
That is all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]...I need to keep the 
conversation going.[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSin][.....][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... You're from Sacae,
right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]What brings you all
the way out here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Nothing special. You appear to be
from Sacae yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]As for me, I'm traveling around
Elibe to train myself, and...[A]
Oh, you didn't ask about me,
did you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]...Sigh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]...I'm looking for someone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Who?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...My clan was crushed by Bern
when they invaded Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Our chieftain had me escape and told me
to find and protect his granddaughter.[A]
I'm still in search of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
Well, I hope you find her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Me too.[A]

[CE]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Fir!
It is you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Sir Noah?!
What are you doing here?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]I joined this army
back in Ostia...[.....] Whoa![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][ToggleSmile]What are you doing?!
Sheathe your sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Noah! You aren't the noble
man I thought you were![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]I know you're a mercenary...
But lending your services to pirates?![A]
You should be ashamed![A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Don't act like you don't know![A]
You're working with pirates to
attack the people living here![A]
And you call yourself a knight?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hold on, I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Misunderstanding?!
You still have the nerve--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We're trying to help
the villagers.[A]
Our goal is to defeat the
head of the pirate group here.[A]
His name is Scott, I think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Scott is the head
of the pirates?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sure is. If you don't believe me why
don't you ask the pirate over there?[A]
The one behind you, hiding in
the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pirate?
What pirate--?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][LoadScollan]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]The plan failed! I gotta
go tell the boss![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Hey!
Come back here![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You didn't suspect
them at all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Scott was very
kind to me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really? The rumors say that
he's a brute of a man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My mother always said that you shouldn't
judge a person by their looks...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, certainly,
but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I was fighting for
pirates this whole time...[A]
What should I do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you want to
come with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Truly?
Can I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]We're always looking for new
recruits to bolster our strength.[A]
I'll talk to Roy for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Thank you![A]

[CF]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadSin]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Sue![A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Sin...
What are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]For me? Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The chieftain told me to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]...What happened to
the clan after I left?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We were no equal
for Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]...We lost.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]What happened to
my grandfather?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He still continues the
resistance against Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint]Is that so...[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]I was told by the chieftain
to find and protect you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]Then you will fight
alongside us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]With you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]This army is fighting against Bern, like
my grandfather. They also saved my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Then of course.[A]
If that is what you desire,
I am at your disposal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]

[D0]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager44]
[ToggleSmile]This whole area is basically
pirate territory.[A]
They take everything
from us.[A][Clear]
Resist, you say?
It's of no use.[A]
They can do whatever they want
because of their numbers.[A]
We can't fight against them
like the resistance force.[A]

[D1]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager47]
[Clear]You saved us![A]
Are you with the resistance?[.....]
No?[A]
Then you just did it out of the
goodness of your heart?[A]
As I'm sure you've seen, these islands
are swarming with pirates and bandits![A]
There's nothing we can do out here,[A]
but word is the resistance is waging
battle in the western part of the Isles.[A]
Tell them we'll all move to the mainland.
They don't have to worry about us...[A]

[D2]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager42]
[ToggleSmile]The only people here are
women and children.[A]
All the workers have been
taken north to the mines.[A]
They aren't even allowed to rest.
They're forced to work until they die...[A]
My brother escaped, but he
was reduced to skin and bone.[A]
That day he came back, he was already
too weak, and he drew his last breath...[A]
Now that I've told you this...can you...[A]
Er, sorry...[A]
I've said too much.
Please forget all of this.[A]
We'll leave the Isles now.[A]

[D3]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
There's so much mist here...[A]
In these conditions, you can never
know if someone's waiting to pounce![A]
Torches can be very useful, even if
you have an eagle-eyed thief with you.[A]

[D4]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager45]
The resistance is faring quite well.[A]
In the north and in the west,
they're always engaged in battle.[A]
Which way will you go?[A]

[D5]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager43]
Among the pirates is a very
skilled nomad...[A]
You can't see him
through all this fog,[A]
but he also has a girl
with him...[A]

[D6]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager45]
The nearby villagers...[A]
They're all deserting the
Isles for the mainland.[A]
It's very sad, really.[A]
If you want to visit, you'd
best do it quickly.[A]
You won't have time to go to both,
so you'll have to decide.[A]

[D7]

[LoadScott][ToggleSmile]Maybe the fog
didn't stop you...[A]
But you must be in rough
shape at least![A]
I'll finish you off![A]

[D8]

[LoadScott][ToggleSmile]Who...
are you?[A]
You're no ordinary army...[A]

[D9]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Merlinus, it appeared the enemy
was trying to ambush us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They must have known
we were coming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]I think there's more to this
than we realize...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right. Clearing out the bandits
may be more difficult than expected.[A]
Ever since Bern's aggressive behavior
started, Elibe has changed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't even know what to expect...[A]
Dragons appearing, Bern's sudden invasion,
the collapse of the Lycian League...[A]
Everything happened so suddenly.[A]
In the end I suppose all we can do is
take it one problem at a time.[A]

[DA]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...
Where do we go from here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's move north
along the coast.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]North...
Toward the mines?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I hear the people living on the islands are
being forced into slave labor there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you think we
should rescue them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If we do, we might be able to
find out who's behind all of this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we must start
somewhere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's not waste time...
Let's head north.[A]

[DB]

[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Now...
Where do we go from here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]Let's head west.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]West?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard there's a resistance
group based there.[A]
They're fighting the bandits
to protect the villagers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They may have information on
what's going on in the Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed.
We need a lead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems like a sound idea,
Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then let's not waste time.
Let's move west.[A]

[DC]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleSmile]Now...
Where do we go from here?[A]
We must choose a direction.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Do you have any ideas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]If we follow the coast north, we will
reach the largest mine on the Isles.[A]
The bandits may be based
around there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, that makes sense.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We have an assignment, and it's
to get rid of the bandits.[A]
We mustn't wander about
aimlessly wasting time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You're right.
Let's head north![A]
