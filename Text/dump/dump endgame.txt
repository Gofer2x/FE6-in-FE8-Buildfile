[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]The demon dragon is here...
Exercise caution, everyone.[A]
This is our last battle![A]
[0201]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIdunnHood][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You're the Dark Priestess...
The demon dragon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...Why do you block my path?[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I have been instructed
to lead this world.[A]
I will bring peace.
Why do you bar my path?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You're wrong.[A]
Peace at the cost of humanity is
hardly any kind of peace at all.[A]
The man who ordered you is gone.
You can stop![A]
You have no reason to fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
None of us have reason
to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]...I feel that eons ago...[A]
I heard those same words.[A]
Soft words, like a warm breeze...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
But that was long ago...[A]
I have slumbered for far
too long.[A]
In the darkness, I dreamed...
An empty dream. Black. Colorless...[A]
But I am awoken now.
His Highness willed it so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]His Highness...
You mean Zephiel![A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
I am awoken. I have left
the darkness of my dreams.[A]
My path is now lit.
I know what I must do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadIdunnHuman][CloseSpeechFast][ToggleMouthMove]I will lead this world...[A]
No matter how much time must
pass, that is my duty...[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]You insist on fighting us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
As long as you
stand in my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Your will...seems unbreakable...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]My will is His Highness's.[A]
I awoke for the purpose of
fulfilling his desires.[A]


[0236]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Now is the time of truth![A]
I have the blade of Hartmut, who took
pity on you and spared your life![A]
Everyone, leave the final blow to me!![A]
[0237]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]I don't want to fight you...
But I can't leave things as they are![A]
The history of man may be tainted...
but we can do great things as well![A]
I will fight and prove that to you![A]
[0238]
[LoadIdunnHuman][ToggleSmile]I...[....]I...[....]
Gah...[.....]I...[A]
I am alone...[.....]
in the dark...[A]
I am alone...[.....]in...[.....]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFae][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]Ah![A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint]Oh no...
The sanctuary is collapsing![A]
Everyone! Hurry outside![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll be fine.[A]
Now go!![A]
[023A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMerlinus][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy!
You are unharmed![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yes...but the sanctuary
is gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It was over a thousand years old.[A]
A great deal of energy was
released in the battle we fought.[A]
The foundations probably couldn't
withstand the pressure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Today marks the beginning
of a new era.[A][Clear]
...Who is that you are
carrying on your back?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][LoadIdunnHood][SendToBack][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, yes.[A]
Merlinus, I need to ask
a favor of you...[A]
[023B]
And thus this conflict, called 
[023C]
"The Great Movement of Bern," ended. 
[023D]
Bern finally surrendered. 
[023E]
Etruria took watch over Bern for a while, 
[023F]
but never directly interfered 
[0240]
in their state affairs. 
[0241]
With the help of Roy, 
[0242]
who played the biggest role in the war, 
[0243]
Bern was rebuilt, 
[0244]
with Guinivere as its queen. 
[0245]
And on the day of her crowning... 
[0246]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]
Today is Princess Guinivere's
crowning ceremony.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I haven't seen her in her
royal garments yet,[A]
but I'm sure she is beautiful
beyond description.[A]
Even at our first meeting,[A]
I had no words to describe
her sheer beauty.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
But she has many
struggles still to come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
After she is crowned queen of Bern,
even with Etruria's support,[A]
I'm certain there will be great
unrest and plots to overthrow her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Some may claim that she only joined
Etruria to seize the throne.[A]
It's an unfortunate reality, but to the
ignorant, that is how it will appear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...But I'm sure she will be fine.[A]
Under her rule, Bern will prosper
like never before...[A]
[ToggleSmile]She's too brilliant and strong
to succumb to petty unrest...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I agree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...What about you?
What will you do now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
I will return to Pherae.[A]
I'm concerned about my
father's illness,[A]
and there is much
reconstruction to be done.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Um...I...
What if we...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... Never mind.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But you're returning to Pherae...
That's good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?[A]
Will you go back to Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes. I must take my
father's place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm glad you're staying
in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Why do you say that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Because if you're in Ostia, then
we can see one another any time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lilina...[A]
I don't know when,
but some day...[A]
I'll come for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...I...I have to
prepare, too...[A][Clear]
But...Roy...
I've always...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A][ToggleSmile]
The ceremony's starting.
Come, Lilina![A]
Let's see Princess...
No, Queen Guinivere![A]
This is the start of her
reign as queen![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What I'm trying to say is...
I've always... Wait, what?![A]
R-Roy, wait for me![A][ClearFace]
[0247]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight]
Princess Guinivere, you have my
congratulations on your ascension.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thank you...[A]
But my battle is
just beginning.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
I wish we didn't have to
rely on Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not at all. I am grateful for
their support.[A][ToggleSmile]
There will be those, however,[A]
who think I only joined
Etruria to seize the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the most important task at
hand is Bern's reconstruction.[A]
I must regain the people's trust
through my efforts.[A]
No matter how long it takes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
If there is anything I can do to
help, please don't hesitate to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you again.
Perhaps I will someday.[A]
Roy, are you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What will you do?[A]
Will you stay in
the Etrurian Army?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, I must return to Pherae.[A]
I am concerned about my
father's illness,[A]
and we must begin the
reconstruction effort.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are returning home?
I am sure that's for the best.[A]
Still...[A]
Someone of your ability could easily
take a place in the Etrurian court.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-me?![A]
I don't think I deserve
such a position![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Pherae is blessed to have
such a gifted heir as you.[A]
[0248]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1][ToggleSmile]Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please call me Guinivere.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Guinivere.
The ceremony is about to begin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.
I will be there shortly...[A]
[0249]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGuinivere][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy, will you
come with me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
You have helped me so much ever since I
left Bern with the Fire Emblem in hand.[A]
I want you to see the path Bern will
take under my leadership.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
If you will have me, then it is
my pleasure to accompany you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Then come...
This way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let us see a new Bern...[.....]
And the beginning of a new era.[A]
[024A]
Later, in Arcadia...
[024B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager19][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Lord Roy.
It has been far too long.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, it is good
to see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fae will be glad
to see you as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I saw her earlier.[A]
She is even more energetic
than I remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We have allowed her outside
more since her return.[A]
Perhaps that is why.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How is Idunn doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We succeeded in restoring
her soul, and yet...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...She's not back
to normal?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fae sometimes takes her outside,[A]
but she will do nothing without
first being told to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...[A]
We had known for long that
she had been captured.[A]
I feared the consequences of
leaving the village, however,[A]
so I forbade any effort to
rescue her.[A]
Now, though, I wonder whether
my judgment was correct...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps the humans are changing
the way I think.[A]
I will do my best to restore
Idunn's heart and soul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You have my
gratitude.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
An expression of emotion would
be a promising first step...[A]
A laugh, for example...[A][OpenMidLeft]
[024C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadIdunnHuman][OpenMidLeft][LoadFae]
And that is called
a tree![.......][.....]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tree...[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right![.....][......]
And this tree has
tasty fruit![.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fruit?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah. [......]Can you see it?[......]
It's up at the top.[.......][......]
And if you [......]shake the tree[......]
like this...[.....][MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oww![MoveMidLeft][LoadOverworldFaces]
[......][.....]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It fell on
my head...[.......][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh...[......]
[OpenMidLeft]Idunn...?[......]
Did you just laugh?[.......][.....]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Laugh...?[......]
This is a laugh?[......][......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where's Roy?[......][......]
[MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]I have to tell Roy
that you laughed![......][......]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][ToggleSmile]Oh no...

[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy!

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...but the

[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, Lord Roy, our
struggle is over.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
No. It hasn't even started yet.[A]
We must help rebuild the land
from the damage caused by the war.[A]
There is much to be done.[A]
The real work is only just
beginning![A]
[0253]
And thus this conflict, called 
[0254]
