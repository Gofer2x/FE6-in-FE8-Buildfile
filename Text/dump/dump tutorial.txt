[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight]
Today, Roy, I will instruct you
in basic combat tactics.[A]

[15]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
First, do you see this
moving square?[A]
This is the cursor, which is used
to give commands to soldiers.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
Let's begin the mock battle.[A]
I'm sure you have questions, but I'll be
here to advise you as needed.[A]

[16]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
To win any battle, you, Roy, must seize
the enemy's main point of defense.[A]
That could be a castle gate, a throne,
or any number of locations.[A]
The enemy leader's position is
the location you want to seize.[A]

[17]

[LoadCecilia]This is the point you must seize
for this training session.[A]
First, make your way
toward the castle gate.[A]
I'll teach you how to move
yourself around the map.[A]

[18]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]Units are soldiers that move
around the field and fight.[A]
Blue units are your allies, and
red units are your enemies.[A]
Let's try moving. Use the
+ Control Pad to move your cursor.[A]
It's already positioned on you,
so you can just press the A Button.[A]

[19]

The blue squares indicate where
you can move.[A]
Use the cursor to select where
to move, and press the A Button.[A]
If you change your mind,
press the B Button to cancel.[A]
Many actions can be cancelled
by pressing the B Button,[A]
so remember that if you
make a mistake.[A]

[1A]

The red squares outside the blue
squares indicate where you can attack.[A]
It appears there's an
enemy unit in a red square.[A]

[1B]

To attack him, move to an area
adjacent to the enemy unit.[A]
Select an area and press
the A Button.[A]

[1C]

Select Attack and
press the A Button.[A]

[1D]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]If an enemy survives your first attack,
it may perform a counterattack.[A]
A unit with much higher speed than
its opponent will attack twice.[A]

[1E]

Look at the red zone,
or the attack range.[A]
For you it was only one space,
but for this unit it's two spaces.[A]
That's because Wolt can attack
from a distance with his bow.[A]
Different weapons can attack
in different ways.[A]

[1F]

Wolt can engage in indirect
combat with his bow.[A]

[20]

To attack with a bow,[A]
your unit must be 1 space
away from the enemy.[A]
Try moving to one of these
spaces.[A]

[21]

Select Attack from
the menu.[A]

[22]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
That was indirect combat
with a bow.[A]
If the enemy has no weapons
capable of indirect combat,[A]
there's no fear of counterattack.[A]
However, you cannot fire
on adjacent spaces.[A]
If someone moves next to
you and attacks, that's it.[A]

[23]

Some weapons,
such as magic and javelins,[A]
can strike enemies in adjacent squares
as well as those at a distance.[A]
As you can see, the red
zone is extended.[A]

[24]

Now you can attack
with magic.[A]

[25]

You can either attack from close
up or keep your distance.[A]

[26]

Select Attack.[A]
Also, do you remember the
R Button?[A]
You can press the R Button to
see help messages here, too.[A]

[27]

[28]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]That was a magic attack.[A]
You can attack from a distance to avoid
counterattacks from many foes,[A]
and you can also attack from an adjacent
square to avoid counterattacks from bows.[A]
I think you'll find magic to be
highly versatile.[A]

[29]

Choose which weapon to equip.[A]

[2A]

Select the enemy to attack.[A]
If there are multiple enemies
in your attack range,[A]
use your cursor to choose the
enemy you want to attack.[A]
Right now there's only one enemy
in range.[A]

[2B]

Now, press the A Button
to attack![A]

[2C]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
If a unit takes a hit,[A]
its HP, or hit points,
will be reduced.[A]
If a unit's HP is reduced
to zero, that unit will be lost.[A]
Once a unit is lost,
it's gone for good.[A]
Also, if you lose all your HP,
Roy, the battle is lost.[A]
That means game over.
So be careful.[A]

[2D]

[2E]

Do you see the Visit command?[A]
If you select it and press the A Button,
you can visit the village.[A]

[2F]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]Visiting villages may earn you
items or money.[A]
You can use any items you obtain
with the Item command.[A]

[30]

[31]

[32]

[33]

[OpenMidRight]
These are a unit's details.
There are many parameters here,[A]
but I won't bore you by
explaining each one.[A]
If you want to know about the
different values,[A]
press the R Button for
more information.[A]
Also, if you press right and left on the
+ Control Pad on this screen,[A]
you can view additional information,
such as held items and weapon skills.[A]
When you're done, press
the B Button to return to the map.[A]

[34]

[35]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]When the enemy's turn is done,
it's your turn again.[A]
The battle proceeds like this
in a turn-by-turn fashion.[A]

[36]

[OpenMidRight][LoadWolt]All right! I'll help
Lord Roy with my bow![A]

[37]

[LoadCecilia]Roy, the archer Wolt came
to help you.[A]
You're not the only unit
you can move.[A]
You have command over all
of your allies, too,[A]
but remember that you are
responsible for their lives.[A]
And one more thing...[A]

[38]

[LoadCecilia]
Do you see where
the cursor is?[A]
This is the entrance
to a village.[A]
You should inform
the village of the battle.[A]
Once you move to the
entrance of a village,[A]
you can select Visit
to inform them.[A]

[39]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]Roy, are you all right?
I'll help you with my magic![A]

[3A]

[3B]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
Do you think you have a grasp
on the basics of battle now?[A][Clear]
Now I'll tell you about one of the
most powerful weapons you have...[A]
Information.[A]
You can press the R Button to 
investigate numerous things.[A]
For example, if you press the R Button while
the cursor is on a unit,[A]
you can view its statistics,
items, and other data.[A]
You can also press the R Button on
commands if you don't understand them.[A]
If there's something you're unsure
of, the R Button is there to help.[A]

[3C]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia]
You will soon approach
the castle.[A]
Like I said before,
to win,[A]
you have to seize the
castle gate or throne.[A]
In other words, where
the enemy leader is.[A]
Bors is leading the enemy
in this training mission,[A]
so your final task is to
defeat him.[A]
Once you've done that, use
the Seize command on the gate,[A]
and victory will be yours![A]

[3D]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
Good! You defeated the enemy leader.[A]
Now, Roy, all that's left is for you to
move onto the castle gate and Seize it.[A]

[3E]

Do you see the Seize command?[A]
Select it and press the A Button
to win the battle.[A]

[3F]

The Rescue command allows you
to carry allies to protect them.[A]
A unit can only be rescued if its Con stat
is lower than the rescuer's Aid stat.[A]
You can see a unit's Con and Aid
values on the unit data screen.[A]
While a unit is carrying another,[A]
its combat statistics are lowered
significantly, so be careful.[A]
After rescuing a unit,[A]
you can drop it onto a space by
using the Drop command.[A]
Or if you prefer,[A]
you can pass it to another unit
with the Give or Take commands.[A]
Remember, however, that you can
only perform one command per turn.[A]

[40]

The Trade command allows a unit
to trade items with other units.[A]
If you select the command and
press the A Button,[A]
the two units' inventories will
be displayed.[A]
You may select which items you
want to trade with the A Button.[A]
If you just want to give or
take an item,[A]
trade that item to an empty
space.[A]
If you give all of a unit's
weapons to another unit,[A]
it won't be able to fight,
however, so use caution.[A]

[41]

[42]

These are commands that you
can give to your units.[A]
Right now, you can see the
Item and Wait commands.[A]
You can issue a command
with the A Button.[A]
The Item command allows you to
equip, use, or discard items.[A]
If you're finished with a unit,
select Wait to end its turn.[A]
Remember that you can cancel
with the B Button,[A]
but if you select Wait you can't
take it back,[A]
so make sure you're finished
before selecting it.[A]

[43]

[44]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
I'll tell you about the map menu now.[A]
Move the cursor to an empty space
and press the A Button.[A]
You can see more information about
each command by using the R Button.[A]

[45]

If you press the A Button when the
cursor is on an unoccupied space,[A]
the map menu appears.[A]
First, look at the bottom command.[A]
You can choose End to end your turn
before moving all of your units.[A]
Just select it and press the A Button
if you're ready.[A]
If you want to return to the map and
the cursor, press the B Button.[A]

[46]

[LoadCecilia]Roy...! Nooo![A]
...That's what I would be saying
if this was a real battle.[A]
This battle is lost.[A]
Don't be discouraged...
We'll try again tomorrow.[A]
Let's get some rest.[A]

[47]

[LoadLilina]
Roy... If this was a real
battle, I'd be dead.[A]
Remember that defeated
allies are gone forever.[A]
Be more careful in real
battles, OK...?[A]

[48]

[LoadWolt]
L-Lord Roy...[A]
This is only a training
session, so I'm fine,[A]
but if this were a real
battle, I would be dead.[A]
When defeated, allies are
gone forever.[A]

[49]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentCharacter][OpenMidRight][LoadVillager1]
Thank you for coming.[A]
Please remember to inform the
villagers in real battles as well.[A]

[4A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia]
Good job! You've captured
the enemy's castle gate.[A]
That finishes our training
session for today.[A]
How do you feel?
Do you think you can do it?[A]
If you ever find yourself in
a real battle,[A]
just remember what you learned
here today and you'll be fine.[A]

[4B]

[LoadBors]Ah, you've made it.[A]
This is a training session,
but a battle all the same.[A]
Don't expect me to go
easy on you![A]

[4C]

[LoadBors]Well... You win.
Nicely done.[A]
