[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Why didn't it slay Idunn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The blade has a strange power that
reflects the wielder's soul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hartmut didn't want to kill her,[A]
so the Binding Blade reflected
that feeling and spared her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
He had apparently heard how the demon
dragon was formed and felt pity for it.[A]
We dragons cannot understand that
illogical feeling.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
He pitied her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
In his soul, he wished to spare Idunn.[A]
I personally would never hesitate to
eliminate a threat as he did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hartmut's soul changed the
sword itself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
After persuading the others that it
should be spared,[A]
Hartmut built a shrine hidden deep
in what you now call Bern.[A]
There, he bound the demon dragon away
using the blade and the Fire Emblem.[A]
After the founding of Bern,[A]
the shrine was protected by the royal
family for generations.[A]
That is, until Zephiel unbound her,
of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...How do you know all this?
Did you witness it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No. After the battle I hid myself
to nurse my wounds.[A]
All I just told you I learned
from Zephiel himself,[A]
who read it in ancient tomes kept
by the Bern royal family.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...How did you meet Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You wish to know that now,
do you?[A]
So be it... Come further,
and I will tell you.[A]

[LoadGuinivere][ToggleSmile]Roy...!

[02A5]
[LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]You...!
You're that girl![A][ClearFace]
[LoadClarine][ToggleSmile]Excuse me?
Have we met before?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]What?!
You have forgotten me?![A]
That...is inconceivable![A]
[02A6]
[LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]You're Melady...
Hah![A]
[ToggleSmile]You betray your home
and join the enemy.[A]
You are a disgrace![A][ClearFace]
[LoadMelady][ToggleSmile]My loyalty has always
lied with the princess.[A]
And so it shall
remain![A][ClearFace]
[02A7]
[LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]You...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadZeiss]General Narcian...[A]
I heard everything
from Sir Galle![A]
Do you...have no sense of
honor left in you at all?![A][ClearFace]
[LoadNarcian]Galle...! He has always
been a thorn in my side![A]
[ToggleSmile]But no matter...[A]
After I wipe you up here,
no one will know the truth...[A]
[02A8]
[LoadNarcian][ToggleSmile]Cecilia...
[ToggleSmile]Back for more, are you?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadCecilia][ToggleSmile]It was Zephiel to whom I lost.
Not you.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadNarcian]Fair enough, but now you will
know my true strength![A]
[02A9]
[LoadNarcian]If it isn't General Perceval,
the back-stabbing traitor![A][ClearFace]
[LoadPerceval][ToggleSmile]
Joining you...was the greatest
mistake of my life.[A]
I will make up for it...
by defeating you![A]
[02AA]
[LoadMurdock][ToggleSmile]You were one of Narcian's
troops.[A]
I heard the story from Galle.[A]
You have my sympathy,
but you are my enemy now.[A]
Come!
We fight![A]
[02AB]
[LoadMurdock][ToggleSmile]Melady...
I don't want to fight you.[A]
But you are here.
It seems we have no choice.[A]
Come![A]
[02AC]
[LoadMurdock]At last, the great
General Roy stands before me![A]
I have been waiting to
match blades with you![A]
[02AD]
[LoadBrunnya][ToggleSmile]You are a knight of Bern.[A]
You have chosen to follow
Princess Guinivere.[A]
You have chosen your path
as I have chosen mine.[A]
[ToggleSmile]If you believe in it,
then fight for it![A]
[02AE]
[LoadBrunnya][ToggleSmile]You are a knight of Bern.[A]
You have chosen to follow
Princess Guinivere.[A]
You have chosen your path
as I have chosen mine.[A]
[ToggleSmile]If you believe in it,
then fight for it![A]
[02AF]
[LoadNarcian]Well, if it isn't
General Perceval, the traitor![A][ClearFace]
[LoadPerceval][ToggleSmile]
Joining you...was the biggest
mistake of my life.[A]
And now I shall repent
for it...by defeating you![A]
[02B0]
[LoadMonke]...A survivor of
the Kutolah?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadSin][ToggleSmile]Monke! Feel the wrath
of the Kutolah![A][ClearFace]
[02B1]
[LoadMonke][ToggleSmile]You are the granddaughter
of the Silver Wolf...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadSue][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[02B2]
[LoadSigune]Thea?
What are you doing here?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh...
You've joined Etruria.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadThea]Captain Sigune...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadSigune]You know the code of the
Ilian knights.[A]
You will get no mercy
from me.[A]
[02B3]
[LoadSigune]You...[A]
You're Juno's youngest sister.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadShanna][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace]
[LoadSigune]
My honor as a knight of
Ilia is at stake.[A]
Don't expect me to
hold back.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadShanna][ToggleSmile]I know...[A][ClearFace]
[02B4]
[LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina?[A]
I see the assassination
failed...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadLilina]Legance...
Why?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadLegance]Times are changing,
milady.[A]
I won't be left in
the dust.[A]
I'm not like Lord Hector.[A]
He was too foolish to
accept the obvious.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadLilina]Hush yourself![A]
I will not let you
insult my father![A]
[02B5]
[LoadBarthe][ToggleSmile]Legance, you miscreant![A]
Have you no shame for your
betrayal of Lord Hector?![A][ClearFace]
[LoadLegance]Barthe...
Shut your ugly mouth.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Lord Hector was a fool.
His death was his own doing.[A]
I do not intend to fall
along with him.[A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadBarthe][ToggleSmile]You'll eat those words![A]
[02B6]
[LoadLegance]Bors! I see
you yet live.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadBors][ToggleSmile]I do.[A]
And I see you took over
Ostia in my absence...[A][ClearFace]
[LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Do you have any
grievances with that?[A]
Take it back yourself...
if you can![A]
[02B7]
[LoadGwendolyn][ToggleSmile]Legance!
You shall fall here![A][ClearFace]
[LoadLegance][ToggleSmile]Ah, Bors' sister, correct?[A]
You have the courage, but can
you truly stand against me?[A]
[02B8]
[LoadDebias][ToggleSmile]Bors! You returned![A][ClearFace]
[LoadBors]Causing a rebellion after
Lord Hector's death?![A]
That is inexcusable![A]
[02B9]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]Klein!
You would betray me?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadKlein]You are the one who betrayed
Etruria, Lord Arcardo![A]
[02BA]
[LoadArcardo][ToggleSmile]D-Douglas![A]
You had turned to the enemy...!?[A]

[02BB]
[LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]Douglas... Hmph![A]
After all that you said, you've
gone back on your honor![A][ClearFace]
[LoadDouglas][ToggleSmile]
Indeed it may appear that way.
But I fight true.[A]
I fight with my heart and I
have confidence in our cause.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadRoartz][ToggleSmile]Silence![A]
Enough of your nonsensical
rambling. Die here![A]
[02BC]
[LoadElen][ToggleSmile]Aren't you...a priest?
The things you've done...[A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadOrlo][ToggleSmile]What of them?[A]
Anything can go unpunished...if
done in the name of the gods![A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadElen][ToggleSmile]...There is no
salvation for you.[A][ClearFace]
[02BD]
[LoadSaul][ToggleSmile]With all the evil you've done,[A]
I dare say you've lost the right
to call yourself a bishop.[A][A][ClearFace]
[LoadOrlo][ToggleSmile]Evil? I am simply living
as I like.[A]
All deeds are righteous if
done in the name of the gods.[A]
Very convenient,
don't you think?[A][ClearFace]
[LoadSaul][ToggleSmile]You're a disgrace to the church...
Punishment awaits you![A][ClearFace]
[02BE]
[LoadGalle][ToggleSmile]I fought honorably...
I accept my death...[A][Clear]

Your hands are full.

Hee hee... I'll send it then.[A]
[02ED]
No? Too bad. You could
take it if you made room.[A]
[02EE]
That's a shame. You could
carry it if you made room.[A]
[02EF]
Ah, well... You could take
it if you made room.[A]

Merlinus is full, too!

Heh... Merlinus is full,
too. Rearrange things...[A]
[02F3]
Welcome to the arena![A]
[02F4]
Would you like to wager
[G] gold?[Yes]
[02F5]
Fight 'til defeat, or press
the B Button to yield.[A]
[02F6]
Bah! What's that?
Get outta here![A]
[02F7]
Good luck. Don't get
yourself killed.[A]
[02F8]
So you won, eh? Here's
your prize. [G] gold.[A]
[02F9]
Ahh, you lost? I'd hoped
for better from you.[A]
[02FA]
What? You yield? Well,
your gold is mine, then![A]
[02FB]
Looks like a draw.
Here's your money. See ya.[A]
[02FC]
You ain't got enough cash.
Come back later.[A]
[02FD]
[OpenLeft][LoadAnna]Do you want to quit?
[Yes]
[02FE]
[OpenLeft]Next time, choose Resume
Chapter to finish this battle.[A]
[02FF]
[OpenLeft][LoadAnna]Do you surrender?
[Yes] 
[0300]
[OpenLeft][LoadAnna]You can do no damage.
Would you like to quit?[Yes]
[0301]
[OpenLeft]Do you want to send
your trial map data?[Yes]
[0302]
[OpenLeft][LoadAnna]Preparing

[0303]
[OpenLeft]Transferring

[0304]
[OpenLeft]Transfer successful.
[0305]
[OpenLeft]The connection has been interrupted.
[0306]
[OpenLeft]No Trial Map data found.
Returning to menu.
[0307]
[OpenLeft][LoadAnna]
All your saved data will be erased.
Shall I continue?[No]
[0308]
[OpenLeft]Erased data cannot be restored.
Are you sure?[No]
[0309]
[OpenLeft]The data's been erased.[A]
[030A]
[OpenLeft][LoadCecilia]Do you want to quit your training?
[Yes]
[030B]
[OpenLeft]Feel free to come back if you
ever need more training.[A]
[030C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lilina, are you all right?
Do you need anything?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, all is well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very well, then. If there's
anything I can do for you--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy, it's all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if you say so...[A]
But if you ever need anything,
tell me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will.[A]
[030D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lilina.[A]
Lilina![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm? Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
You were spacing out again.[A]
This is a battlefield.
You could get killed![A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's just that...
we've come so far.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm not talking about distance...[A]
It's just that everything seems
to have changed so quickly.[A]
Do you remember back when you
first came to Ostia to study?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
It was two years ago...[A]
Wait, or was it three
years ago?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Our fathers were still both well.
Lycia was peaceful...[A]
No one could have imagined
this war.[A]
...It was only a few years ago,
yet it feels like an eternity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, just listen to me...[A]
There's no going back to
those days, is there...?[A]
[030E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][ToggleSmile]
Roy...I'm sorry
about before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was reminiscing about before
the war.[A]
It's all changed... I need to accept
that nothing will ever be the same...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, some things will
never change.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Like us. We'll always
be together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We can't go back to the past, but we're
the ones who will build the future.[A]
We'll make the future as good as--no,
better than the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's you. Talking like that.
Are you trying to charm me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
W-was it that obvious?[A]
Yeah, I guess it was a
little overly grand...[A]
[OpenMidRight]But really...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And you're right...
We'll be together forever.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Of course.[A]
[030F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadMarcus]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter, Marcus?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're not good.
Not good at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's not good?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The young recruits. Their combat
skills leave much to be desired.[A]
Granted, not all of them are
disappointments, but most are soft![A]
What they need is a more intense
training regimen...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't know if I'd call anyone
soft... Everyone's working hard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My Lord Roy, you are far
too easy on them.[A]
I shall go and teach them
how we used to do things![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Just don't work yourself
too hard.[A]
You're not as...well, youthful
as you used to be.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nonsense![A]
I may be getting on in years, but I'm
still more than a match for the youth![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
If you think more training is
what they need, then go ahead.[A]
Just take care not to overwork
yourself. Age can be cruel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, my lord.
Thank you for your concern.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Roy is such a caring and
thoughtful young master...[A]
The other youths we have can't
even compare... It's a disgrace![A]
I'm the only one who can serve
our Lord Roy properly.[A]
[0310]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadMarcus]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, I believe training needs
to be made more difficult.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]More difficult?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, my lord.[A]
And those who fail to perform
up to par should be discharged.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
Such rules may make our numbers small,
but we will be an army of elites.[A]
That would increase our combat
efficiency several times over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Marcus.
I don't think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
Why not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who's to judge whether someone
is performing up to par?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Why, you, naturally,
Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But some soldiers may excel
while I'm not looking.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes...
Well, in that case...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
We also have people supporting
us off the battlefield,[A]
and yet more who simply haven't
yet had a chance to shine.[A]
I couldn't discharge such
soldiers.[A]
Many have joined us thanks to
their belief in our fight.[A]
I can't simply tell them
to leave.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
Marcus, try to trust them.
We're all working together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You are right.[A]
I was mistaken, Lord Roy.
Your ideas are noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's strange to hear
you praise me.[A]
I'm more used to hearing
you scold me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. But thank
you, Marcus.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Roy... He has grown
into a fine young man...[A]
I'm certain he can make it
on his own.[A]
My work is nearly
complete...[A]
[0311]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadMarcus]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Marcus, is something wrong?
You seem unwell.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I apologize, my lord.[A]
I have been considering
retirement...[A]
Age has worn me down...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retirement?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The young soldiers have grown strong.
Perhaps now is the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Marcus.
You can't be serious.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have grown old...[A]
A feeble old man like me
has no place at your side.[A]
It is time I made way for
the next generation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I will retire soon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No!
I still need you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sorry about what I
said to you before.[A]
But you don't need to
retire yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But I'm far too old...
I have no place on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I still have much to learn
from you.[A]
If you leave...to whom
can I turn for advice?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Roy... I had no idea
you trusted me so much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't retire yet...
I need your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight]As you will, my lord.[A]
I shall serve you
until the day I die.[A]
[0312]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy,[.....]
is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Just call me Roy.
I've known you all my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I appreciate your kindness,
but rules are rules.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Do you really think so?[A]
You suddenly feel so
distant to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What are you saying?
I'm right here in front of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not what I meant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, I know.[A]
But enough talk.[A]
We haven't time to
laze about here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's go![A]
The battle awaits us,
Lord Roy.[A]
[0313]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wolt!
About before...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Roy, the issue
was settled.[A]
More importantly, this
is a battlefield.[A]
You never know where
enemies are hiding.[A]
Keep on your guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wolt...[A]
You're starting to sound
like Merlinus and Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Am I?[A]
Thank you!
That is such praise.[A]
All I desire is to be as
loyal a servant as they are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy?
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[A]
Leave me alone for
a while, would you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...?[A]
[0314]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You do not look well. Is there
something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Actually, there is.[A]
Would you mind if we
talked about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course not!
I'll do my best to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You see, I'm a bit frustrated
with someone in the army.[A]
I understand where he's coming
from, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You understand his logic, but your
feelings don't agree. Is that it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, exactly.[A]
My feelings don't align with what
I know to be true.[A]
And when I start feeling frustrated,
I feel like telling him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then do so![A]
It is bad for your health to
keep your feelings bottled up.[A]
Besides, we all know you are
in a stressful position.[A]
I'm sure he will understand if
you feel the need to vent.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course![A]
If you want, I can go talk to
that person.[A]
I will always support you, so don't
hesitate to ask anything of me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thanks, Wolt.
I feel better now.[A]
But enough chatter!
We have to get moving![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lord Roy![A]
[ToggleSmile]...By the way, tell me who it
is you're frustrated with.[A]
I will sit him down and have
a frank discussion...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
...Who was it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He's closer than you realize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? Where?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Was it...me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You got it![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy![A]
[0315]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
How should I
move next, Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes.[A]
You should...
...Um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nothing. It's just that...[A]
It feels so strange giving
you orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
You lead this army.[A]
Who else would give
me orders?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Roy, you mustn't go soft.[A]
If a leader gets soft,
then so will the troops.[A]
You are a general leading an
army, and I am your soldier.[A]
Be strict and assertive,
as a general should be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good.[A]
Now, General Roy,
what is my next move?[A]
[0316]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, General Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Are you tired?
Perhaps you should rest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I can't. We must
keep moving.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Rushing forward will only
lead us to failure.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not rushing, but we must move
as quickly as possible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The quicker we move, the
more lives will be saved.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, that's true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We fight to win this war.[A]
But how can we call it a victory with
the deaths of so many innocents?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't
mean to talk back to you.[A]
Are you cross with me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not at all. I was too focused
on a simple victory.[A]
You are already becoming a
worthy leader.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please, enough flattery...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But...hearing it from
you is encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[0317]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
What are you going to do
once this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sorry?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Do you think
you've won already?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...
Not at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
We must rebuild Etruria,
so first I will go home.[A]
Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering if you could teach
me more after the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Like I did in Ostia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Exactly![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There's no need for that now.
You've become a true leader.[A]
There is nothing left for me
to teach you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Roy, you must have confidence.[A]
Troops will not follow a leader
who lacks confidence.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes, you're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is my last lesson
for you.[A]
You are no longer a student.[A]
You are a colleague and
a friend.[A]
So if there's anything I can
assist you with after the war,[A]
it would be my pleasure to
help you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
I will always be on your side.
Never forget that.[A]
[0318]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sophia?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Please...don't strain
yourself today...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I sense something ominous...
in this battle...[A]
Please stay off the
front lines...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I understand.[A]
But I'm not sure I'll be able to
pay full heed to your warning.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
When I go up front...it's
because I trust the others.[A]
I can't hide myself in the
back in fear.[A]
I have to fight alongside
everyone else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I appreciate the warning,
but...I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0319]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Sophia? Do you
sense something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
No... I just wanted
to apologize...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Apologize?
To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About before...[A]
I told you I sensed something
ominous about the battle...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...[A]
You already have much
on your mind...[A]
I shouldn't have
burdened you so...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
No, it's all right.[A]
I'm actually glad that
you told me.[A]
I was more cautious
that day. Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you hadn't told me anything,
I wouldn't have been so cautious.[A]
I may have been hurt badly.
So thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Tell me if you sense anything.
It's a great help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... I will...[A]
[031A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...
I must tell you something...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My power...is weak...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can see the future...
but only blurry images...[A]
I may not see...something
truly powerful...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Something truly powerful?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
If I fail to sense something
powerful...and if you are hurt...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thanks, but I'll be fine.[A]
We'll figure it out when
the time comes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sensing the future is an
amazing ability.[A]
We can prevent disasters
before they even occur.[A]
But I won't rely on your power
too much, so don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm more concerned about your
well-being than your predictions.[A]
I'm sure we'll face many hardships
as we continue...[A]
But keep your spirits up and there's
nothing we can't overcome.[A]
Let's go![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right...
Thank you...Lord Roy...[A]
[031B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Whew, I've finally finished
outlining the troops' positions...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?![A]
Oh, Sue. Hello.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter? You have
a strange look on your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was just surprised
that you spoke to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I never see you speaking
with other people.[A]
You don't like talking
much, do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not the reason.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It isn't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I simply prefer communing
with nature over people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nature?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The breeze, the trees,
the sky, the brooks...[A]
They all speak to us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]They do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They do.
Listen and you'll hear them.[A]
You can't hear them simply
because you don't listen.[A]
I bid you farewell for now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait, you didn't have
anything to tell me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did.
I just told you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Listen to nature, and you'll
hear all sorts of voices.[A]
It will bring you peace of
mind and soul.[A]
You won't be able to hear them
if you're tense all the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sue...[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]
[OpenMidRight]Was she trying to help me
because I look so tired...?[A]
Thank you, Sue.[A]
[031C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight]Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks for your advice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You look better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your aura...
has improved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is softer.
More comfortable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think so?
I can't really tell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm hm hm...[A]
Perhaps such things cannot be
sensed by those who work the land.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's the first time
I've heard you laugh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
Your laugh has a good
aura to it, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thank you.[A]
[031D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]What are you going to do
when this war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll return to Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But wasn't the Kutolah clan
destroyed by Bern...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We will gather everyone once more.[A]
Perhaps the Kutolah name is no more,
but our clansmen survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's... Well, I guess that's
the right thing to do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I thought if you had no place to
go that you could come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pherae...
Your home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right...[A]
It's not a huge area, but it's
a nice and peaceful place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It would be nice...[A]
But my heart belongs in
the plains of Sacae.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[A]
But tell me if you ever
change your mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you for your concern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're very welcome.[A]
[031E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft]What's the matter, Lord Roy?
Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I just noticed that
you seem so...carefree.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hey! Are you making
fun of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not at all.
I'm envious, actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I still think I'm being
made fun of.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Trust me, I'm not making fun of you.[A]
You see, as the leader, I must always
appear confident and optimistic.[A]
I worry and despair like everyone
else, though.[A]
So I wanted to ask you.[A]
How can I be as carefree as you?
Can you offer me any tips?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tips?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You know, things I can do or a mindset
I should have, or anything really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[A]
Eat well, sleep well,
and laugh well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Is that all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Probably.[A]
That's all it takes to
enjoy life, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure you feel you have to
think deeply in your position...[A]
But it's probably not as
complicated as you think.[A]
[031F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight]
You said you're a pegasus
knight-in-training, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Why are you fighting
outside of Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the rule.[A]
Fighting outside of Ilia gets us
experience we won't get in the country.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What kind of experience?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We can see foreign fighting styles,
foreign cultures...[A]
And of course, there's the money.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Then shouldn't you fight in other
armies and see what they're like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Huh? No, there's no need for that![A]
There's no other army that travels
all over like this one.[A]
I couldn't ask to be in a better
army than this for my training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, all right.
If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...Were you worried
about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I guess so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hee hee hee!
Thanks![A]
[0320]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidRight]
Shanna, what will you do
when the war is over?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
Lemme think... First off,
I'll probably go back to Ilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your home?
I'd love to![A]
I want to see it
at least once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, it's not as big as Ostia
so you might be disappointed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure my hometown is way
smaller than yours.[A]
Plus it snows a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Great. Then you
should like it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll look forward to it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure.[A]
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy is so kind...[A]
Inviting a simple mercenary
like me to his home...[A]
Wait...
Does that mean...?[A]
No, no, don't get any crazy
ideas... But still... Hmm...[A]
[0321]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Lord Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]Wha--?![A]
[OpenFarRight]L-Larum...![A]

I finally found you! I want
to show you something.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
W-wait!
Just take it easy...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]What...was it you wanted
to show me?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]It's like this![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]H-hold on a moment.
I can hear you from over here...[A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][SendToBack]
[OpenMidLeft]
I want you to see the
new dance I came up with.[A]
It goes like this...[A][Clear]
Step and twirl,
step and twirl...[A][Clear]
So? What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It was very nice. I think you're
an exceptionally skilled dancer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Is that it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You don't...have more to say?[A]
Like, "Beautiful!" or, "Lovely!"
or, "Your hair looks nice today!"[A]
Or something like that...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Erm...
I had better get going...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, sorry...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]Lord Roy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile]L-Larum...![A]
I don't think you should grab
on to people like that...[A]
It might cause a
misunderstanding.[A]
[SendToBack]
[OpenRight]
But Lord Roy...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][Clear]
Oh!![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]What?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Eeek!
An enemy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Enemy?!
Where?![A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
I don't know! But I heard a
rustling in the bushes...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
L-Larum! Calm down...[A]
I can't move if you're
hanging off me like that...[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
I'm going to die![A]
But...that's OK.[A]
If I can die protecting you,
Lord Roy, I will die in peace.[A]
You, hiding in the bushes!
Show yourself![A]
Our love is eternal
and can never be broken![A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]P-please, get off of me
so I can fight...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Larum...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
There you are! I have
another dance to show you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yeah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...?[A]
Are you...
avoiding me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah...[A]
N-no!
Not at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You are so.[A]
I saw you step back
when I came.[A]
You're bracing yourself
so you can dodge me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-you're imagining things.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't look away when
you talk to me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]B-but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
You don't like me...[A]
You don't want to see
my dancing at all![A]
That's it, isn't it?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Th-that's not true!![A]
[SendToBack][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]
Really?! Thanks!
That makes me so happy![A][SendToBack]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A]
[0324]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmmm....[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something wrong,
Lord Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! Alen.[A]
Sorry, I was lost
in my thoughts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You seem to be thinking a lot
these days, Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What are you
worried about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I was just thinking about
how to move our troops.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How to move the troops?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The enemy grows stronger all the time
so strategies quickly become obsolete.[A]
I was wondering how to effectively
break through their defensive lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's easy, Lord Roy!
Just allow me to charge in.[A]
I will shatter their shields
and pierce their armor![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thanks for the offer, but I don't
want to put you in danger.[A]
There must be another way...
I'll think on it some more.[A]
[0325]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, I have an idea of how to
break through the enemy's defenses...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]An idea?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We leave our best troops behind, and send
the weaker ones to the front lines.[A]
Once the enemies are weakened, the stronger
troops will be able to finish them.[A]
Please, allow me to be in the front lines
with the other weaker soldiers![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But then we would risk losing you
and everyone you're with...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We might suffer some casualties,
but we will win the battle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Alen, I can't
use that idea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-why not, milord?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can't use a strategy that I
know will cause casualties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But Lord Roy, casualties
are unavoidable in war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think not.[A]
It may be naive to say so, but a victory
with casualties is no victory at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You want a complete victory...
Is that possible in war?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think it is.
We need another plan.[A]
[0326]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still thinking,
Lord Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I haven't thought of
a good strategy yet...[A]
But yours is out of the
question, understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Lord Roy.[A]
But if there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...To be honest, I'm not sure I agree
that a complete victory is possible.[A]
But if that's what you believe, then I
will support you any way I can.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Alen.[A]
I will prove to you that we
can win without casualties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I look forward to the day
of our glorious victory![A]
[0327]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][NormalPrint][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy!
Are you unharmed?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I lost sight of you for a moment
so I assumed the worst...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh. Is that all?
Don't worry so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
No, Lord Roy.
You lead this army.[A]
You must always be
on your guard.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I promise you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0328]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Lord Roy, if I may
offer a suggestion.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think you should stay
behind the front lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I know what you're thinking,
but please understand.[A]
As our leader, you are
crucial to the army.[A]
If an army's leader is lost,
then so is the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then please, milord, allow me
to escort you this way...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait.[A]
I have no right to order others if
I prioritize my safety above all else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm not exactly a genius, and I'm
not especially charismatic, either.[A]
I have to gain everyone's trust by
experiencing the same hardships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't have that special something
that makes someone a leader.[A]
That's why I need to fight up
front along with everyone else.[A]
[0329]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadRoy][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Lance, I've been thinking
about what you said,[A]
but I still think that I
should stay up front.[A]
I know you only think of
keeping me safe, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I may have been too
forceful with my opinion.[A]
Do what you believe to
be correct.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
It puts my mind at ease
to hear you say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I still believe you were wrong
about one thing, however.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]You do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
You said that you're not a genius
and that you lack charisma.[A]
[OpenMidRight][NormalPrint]Yes, I did say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
Your intelligence and charisma are
exactly why people follow you.[A]
None would give their life for
someone who lacks those traits.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]
Of course.[A]
If you will allow me one
piece of advice,[A]
no matter what happens,
stay true to your heart.[A]
As long as you do that,
your troops will follow you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][FastPrint][ToggleSmile]I'll do my best.
Thank you, Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][FastPrint]
It's my pleasure,
milord.[A]
[032A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight]Eeek!

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
W-what's wrong, Clarine?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You look absolutely
stunning in that outfit![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...That's all?[A]
And here I was wondering what
kind of danger you were in...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My dear brother Klein![A]
Everyone is so aesthetically
handicapped in this army![A]
You are a lone diamond
shining in the rough![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You only think so
because we're family...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I do not![A]
There are none in this world
who can match your beauty.[A]
Knight General Perceval may
have more authority,[A]
but you clearly have superior
sense in beauty![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...Clarine, a lady shouldn't
verbalize such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I only say what
is true.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Clarine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But if that's what you think,
Brother, I will try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good.[A]
[032B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine, come here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Klein?
How do you fare today?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not well, I'm afraid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Is it true that you spoke harshly to
a cleric and made her cry yesterday?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Absolutely not. I did not make her cry.
She is the one who chose to cry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...But she cried because
of what you said to her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was her fault! She was trying
to keep you for herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...She healed your wounds
before I got the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Clarine![A]
[OpenMidRight]I wanted to heal your injuries so
you would be proud of me![A]
All I want is to be of some help
to you, Brother...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was proud of you.[A]
I was so glad that my naive little
sister had grown up so much...[A]
But now that you've done this, I
don't know what to think anymore...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'll never do it again![A]
Please don't hate me, Klein![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
I could never hate you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you, Klein![A]
[032C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong, Clarine?
You look sad.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I don't want to go back
to the manse after the war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why not?[A]
Mother and Father anxiously
await our return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I do want to see Mother and Father...[A]
But if I return to the manse, I will
be nothing but a doll once more.[A]
Never again to see the outside world,
concerned only with decorating myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that is how most
Etrurian ladies are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know...[A]
But being the most elegant in Etruria
does not seem as appealing as it once did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's because you're growing and
maturing, Clarine.[A]
If you stay at the manse, you could
live your life without any worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But it would be so
horribly boring![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed...
All right, here's what we will do.[A]
Once this war is over, we will first
let Mother and Father know we are safe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From there we can discuss your
future and what you want to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, I already know what
I want to do![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I will become Mage General
like General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Err...
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
As Mage General, I will give you, the
new Archer General, my full support.[A]
Then we shall be together always![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...
Let's be realistic...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, how wonderful it would be for us both
to wear that elegant general uniform...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Clarine...[A]
You haven't grown at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No. Never mind.[A]
[032D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight]Oh! We certainly
do meet a lot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You will address me

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
I want to tell
you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]It is about your appearance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
You actually do have quite
an attractive face.[A]
Of course, it is no comparison
to my beloved brother Klein's,[A]
but for a commoner, you aren't
entirely hideous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

I can use my Etrurian aesthetic sense to
make you into a truly handsome noble...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

I won't let you go this time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Leave me be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
That is no way to respond
to a lady's kindness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're getting
on my nerves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That is no way to talk

That...is not how a proper

It is no wonder you don't

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thank you for rescuing me in
my time of need...[A]
I know it is far overdue, but I

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...That's not like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't try to be someone
you're not.[A]
You're good at screaming,
so stick with that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-what do you

[OpenMidRight]
You will address me
as Lady Clarine![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

than tailing me everywhere.[A]
You might actually be useful

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm foul, all right.
Probably best just to avoid me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...You are manipulating me. I will

I always regretted not
being able to meet you.[A]
But finally, here you are![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
OK, yeah... So now
you've seen me.[A]
Satisfied?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Then you'll stop hovering
over me wherever I go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, no, I'll follow you to
the ends of the continent![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Anything
but that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You saved my brother's life.
I owe you a debt of gratitude.[A]
I want to hear all about my brother.[A]
Oh, you could regale me with tales
for hours...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Maybe I could,
but I won't.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh! Wait, Dieck![A]
Come back!
I'll never let you go![A]
[0333]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight]
Oh?
And you are...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah, you must be Lady Clarine
of House Reglay.[A]
I am Lance, knight of Pherae.[A]
We are honored to have someone
of your stature among us.[A]
I apologize for any impudence you
may have experienced from the men.[A]
The soldiers are simply a bit
anxious because of this war.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
Yes, consider them forgiven.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't often grant favors
like this so easily.[A]
Consider it an honor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I thank you, milady.
Now, let me take your hand...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My... So civil and
gentlemanly![A]
For a country knight,
that is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am honored.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-of course, your manners are nothing
compared to our knights back home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please forgive my
breeding, milady.[A]
[0334]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine]
[OpenMidRight]Lance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Clarine. Is there anything
I can do for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]As the daughter of House Reglay,[A]
I order you to serve as my
bodyguard henceforth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In truth, you are a bit on the
feeble side...[A]
But I don't have many knights to
choose from, so you will do.[A]
You must stay by my side and
defend me at all times.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If Lord Roy orders it,
it will be done.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...
I'm ordering it! Me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If I may object, milady, I cannot
follow your orders directly.[A]
A knight must serve his lord,
and only his lord.[A]
One who fails in that is no
longer a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I knew that![A]
I was merely testing your
knightly integrity![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, milady.
Forgive me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, well,
you passed my test.[A]
Stand proud, knight![A]
[0335]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadClarine]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lance![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if you are not mine to order...
Are we not a lady and knight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed we are, milady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]In-indeed...[A]
As such, I hereby permit
you to kiss my hand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, milady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lance, I don't want you to
misunderstand.[A]
The kissing of my hand is a symbol
of the difference in our status.[A]
There is no more meaning to it
than that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course, milady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
Of course...[A]
You're not...
disappointed...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say
something, milady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-no!
Nothing![A]
Back to your duties,
knight![A]
[0336]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh?
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes? Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do you dress yourself
in men's clothing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that strange...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course! A lady must wear
elegant dresses.[A]
And a lady must be dressed
properly even when she fights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really...?
I suppose you're right.[A]
I know nothing about that
kind of stuff...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... So I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose I can teach
you all that I know.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What? N-no![A]
Being ladylike
doesn't suit me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't be absurd!
All ladies must be ladylike.[A]
No gentleman will even give you
the time of day if you look like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]D-do you think so...?[A]
Well...if you're serious...
then all right![A]
Please teach me,
Lady Clarine![A]
[0337]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][OpenMidLeft]
So... Dorothy, what is
your schedule like?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm pretty busy even off
the battlefield.[A]
I help cook meals and
stuff...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?![A]
Leave such dirty jobs to that
plebeian Merlinus fellow![A]
[OpenMidRight]P-plebeian?
Sir Merlinus is plebeian?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
How do you take care
of your hair?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wash it with water.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?!
I don't believe this...![A]
Here, use this shampoo.[A][ToggleSmile]
Wash your hair with it
three times a day![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Th-three times?[A]
But...it looks so expensive...[A]
I appreciate it, but I think
it would be wasted on me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of that now!
I am offering it to you.[A]
Please, take it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh... Well, thank you,
I guess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Additionally...you must change
your speech patterns.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Try to speak more like me,
with a refined, elegant tone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um... OK...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]My, such a beautifious day![A]
Let us partake of the tea
and of the crumpets.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...This will take much work...[A]
First things first. You must learn
how to take care of your hair,[A]
and how to choose your dresses,
and how to dance properly,[A]
and how to turn down offers
from men...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That much?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is just to start.
You mustn't give up![A]
The path to becoming a refined
lady is a difficult one indeed![A]
[OpenMidRight]So it seems...[A]
[0338]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarine][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um... Lady Clarine?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've been trying really hard to
be a lady, but...[A]
Nothing seems to have changed.[A]
No one seems to even notice.
Maybe I should just give up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry! I know you were
just trying to help me...[A]
But it's not your fault![A]
There wasn't much to work
with anyway...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy![A]
That is exactly what's
wrong with you![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Listen to me.[A]
A fine lady must have
confidence in herself.[A]
No matter how you dress,
without faith in yourself,[A]
it is completely and
utterly without meaning.[A]
Do not devalue yourself so.
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yeah, I think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Have confidence in yourself![A]
With me as your teacher, you
will be the finest of ladies![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you,
Lady Clarine...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...One additional matter...[A][ToggleSmile]
We are friends now,
are we not?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't call me
"Lady" Clarine.[A]
Simply "Clarine"
will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, right. OK.

how to properly drink tea![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
Why do I stay the same?![A]
You used to be as

[OpenMidRight]
I am half dragon...so I grow
more slowly than humans...[A]
But you...grow even
slower than I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why do I stay small?
Why don't I grow up like you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You are a full-blooded dragon...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Yes, I was.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She came to play with me.[A]
When I was sad, she snuck in
with Sophia to play with me.[A]
She told me all about the
outside world.[A]

But she stopped coming to
play with me.[A]
I asked Sophia about her,
but she wouldn't tell.[A]
Is it my fault?
Was I a bad girl to her?[A]
Did I make her angry

[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Never you mind.[A]
Fae, take a look at
this gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Once upon a time, humans and...
demons lived in this land.[A]
The demons used their immense
power to hurt the humans.[A]
The weak humans could do nothing
but watch as the bodies piled up...[A]
And then one day...
eight bright rays of light came.[A]
They could be used to defeat
the demons.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Were they pretty lights?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh my, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...The humans used the lights to
fight against the demons.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Um...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Yeah!
The pretty lights![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
To tell you the truth...
I always feared those demons.[A]
After studying dark magic and
the history of mankind...[A]
only then did I discover just how
terrifying the demons were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
But after meeting you...my fear
seems to have vanished completely.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pay it no mind.[A]

must bore you.[A]
Here, go play
with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yay![A][ClearFace][.......]

[OpenMidRight]As you wish, Fae.[A]

Is it your full name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, my real name is reeeeally long.[A]
And they say it's a sound humans
can't hear.[A]
Fae's the only part that you can.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ummmm...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Are you a boy or a girl?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Which do you think?[A]

'cause you're pretty and smell nice![A]
But the other day Roy called
you "he".[A]
Are you a boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am.
...Are you disappointed?[A]

[OpenMidRight]It was my pleasure, Chieftain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It must have been a difficult journey.
Where did you go after you left us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
After we lost the battle, I crossed
many lands in search of Sue.[A]
I rode through Lycia and crossed
the ocean to the Western Isles.[A]
That is where I found her.[A]
It was several months after you
gave me the order.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Much time has passed since
we lost that battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chieftain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We lost many of our clansmen.
...Young ones, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you survived, Chieftain.[A]
No matter how divided the clan may
be you can unite us once more.[A]
[0349]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
The nations in the west, Lycia
and Etruria,[A]
were very different from Sacae.[A]
There were soldiers clad in heavy armor
that would allow no arrows to pass.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So I would imagine.[A]
In the vast plains of Sacae, horses
are our livelihood.[A]
But in more populated areas,[A]
key points are defended by soldiers
such as the ones you speak of.[A]
It is not surprising that our
tactics fail on foreign ground.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Betrayal and trickery are
simple tactics to them.[A]
It is only us who think such
methods dishonorable.[A]
It is no surprise we lost
with such a mindset.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But...I cannot accept
such...dirty tactics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must accept the fact that
people use them, though.[A]
We must be prepared for them
when they are used against us.[A]
[034A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Our Father the Sky has brought us
blessings in spite of our hardships.[A]
I think you have been especially
blessed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The land isn't as it used to be.[A]
We of Sacae must have broader
perspectives.[A]
We must think outside of
the clans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Chieftain...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You seem to have learned much
in your travels.[A]
This old wolf is too old to
learn new ways of thinking.[A]
But you are young.[A]
You are responsible for leading
Sacae to a brighter future.[A]
Consider this an order from
your Chieftain, Sin.[A]
It is the youth that will
decide Sacae's fate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Chieftain...[A]
[034B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Sue, please step back.[A]
It's not wise to linger
around the front.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sin, this is a battle.
I must be up front to fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will do the fighting.
You must remain safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My archery skills are much
better than they once were.[A]
I'm sure I can be of help
to the army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have orders from the
Silver Wolf to keep you safe.[A]
I will not allow you to put
yourself in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Very well.
Then I will do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sound like Grandfather
when you argue with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is the highest praise
you could give me, Sue.[A]
I respect the Silver Wolf
more than any other man.[A]
[034C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Sue, you're still up
front, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand your concern, but I can't
sit around doing nothing, either.[A]
I can't stand watching the others
fight while I hide in safety.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that feeling.[A]
But Sue, don't push
yourself too far.[A]
You are the clan's
last hope.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is all the more reason
I should be up front and fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That depends on the place and time.[A]
Not everyone will follow somebody just
because she fights on the front lines.[A]
Sue, we have a clear goal we must
work towards.[A]
We must gather our people and rebuild
the Kutolah.[A]
Please do not forget that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't push yourself too far
in an attempt to protect me.[A]
I am not the only one working
to reunite the clan.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.
I shall remember that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you. Do you promise
not to overstretch yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I do.[A]
[034D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadSin][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sin, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is the matter, Sue?
You look troubled...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I heard you were ambushed...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sin, I want you to retreat
to the back lines.[A]
I will take over for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What are you saying, Sue?
It should be you in back![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, this is an order.
Step back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Retreat to the back lines, Sin!
Will you disobey my order?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is something wrong?
You're not acting like yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Everyone...everyone was
killed by Bern's forces...[A]
I failed to track down the
traitor and...[A]
they were all killed,
right before my eyes...[A]
I was helpless, Sin.[A]
I never want to feel that again.
I don't want to lose you![A]
[OpenMidRight]Sue...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must not die before I do.
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was ordered to protect you, Sue.
I will not die and leave you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Swear it to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I swear to our Father the Sky
and our Mother the Earth.[A]
[034E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You're...
Sin, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You joined this army, too?
What a coincidence.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
It is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Um... Oh yeah.[A]
Did you find the woman
you were looking for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I-I'm sorry...
Maybe I shouldn't have asked...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No...
It's fine.[A]
I found her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you did?
That's nice to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[034F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight]Sin![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I never asked you.
Which clan are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you from Bulgar?[A]
Or are you one of the Djute
that betrayed us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Was that...
a joke?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-no, it wasn't.[A]
I lived alone with my parents so I
don't know much about the clans...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, you're from
the Kutolah, right?[A]
You said so before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[A]
Our chieftain is the Silver Wolf,
the strongest warrior in Sacae.[A]
None can match his mastery of
the sword and bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You admire him greatly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can you tell?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I can tell by your eyes.
You're usually foreboding...[A]
I-I mean, quiet...[A]
But you look proud talking
about him.[A]
[0350]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're...strange.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I am?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sacaen women rarely pick up weapons,
and when they do, they choose the bow.[A]
Rarely does one see a girl pick up
a sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Also...[A]
Sacaen people worship the
Sky and the Earth.[A]
You don't pray, and you don't
even belong to a clan...[A]
I have never met a Sacaen
like you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not accusing you.
I actually respect it.[A]
You've shown me...that
people can live freely.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think you're
exaggerating...[A]
But it still feels
nice to hear that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have beautiful eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That must be because you look
straight ahead to your dreams.[A]
To mastering the sword.[A]
I will pray for your dream
to be granted one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh! Thank you![A]
[0351]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
......[A][Clear]
......[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][ToggleMouthMove]...Sigh...[A]
Why am I hiding here?
I want to talk to him, but...[A]
He's a little...scary.[A]
I want to see if we can show each
other any tricks with the bow.[A]
But how can I approach him?
Well...maybe some other time...[A]
[0352]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]Hello, Sin!
My name is Dorothy.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...A little too sudden?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Would you like to have an
archery duel?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...But I don't want to
compete with him.[A]
[ToggleSmile]What a nice bow!
Where did you buy it?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...No, that doesn't sound
right at all.[A]
Hmm... This is tough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, I know![A]
I can bring him some food
that he likes...[A]
Wait, but I have no idea
what he likes...[A]
I like fruit,
but what about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm... Well...
I need to think some more...[A]
[0353]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
...But why am I worrying
so much over him?[A]
...I can't figure that
out, either.[A]
Anyway, I have to figure
out a way to talk to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Um, uh...er...[A]
[ToggleSmile]H-hello![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, hello...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, wh...what...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]W-what...what...kind...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What kind food of do like you?[A]
...Shoot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're asking what kind of food
I like, right? I like fruit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
...Did you hear me
talking to myself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was difficult not to
with such a loud voice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you wish to talk to me,
don't hesitate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
We fight together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right![A]
[0354]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][ToggleSmile]Whoa![A][ClearFace][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]What are you doing, shooting at me?!
I'm on your side![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh, right.
You are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean, "Oh, right"?![A]
A wyvern rider like me is finished
if I'm hit with an arrow.[A]
Just watch it, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][CloseSpeechFast]He sees me as an enemy.[A]
I can't really blame him
after what Bern did to Sacae.[A]
But we're allies...
We can't be quarrelling...[A]
I guess I should try to get
to know him better.[A]
[0355]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight]Hey, Sin!
How are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fine, as you can see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're really great with your bow, huh?
You hit almost all of your targets.[A]
I wish I could hit like you, but I'm
kinda...[......] Whoa!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look out![A][MoveLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]!![A]
[OpenMidRight]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft]...Hm.
I missed his throat.[MoveMidLeft][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I thought I'd finished
him already...[A]
Sorry to make you clean
up after my mistake...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I moved on reflex.
It was no trouble.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter.
You still saved my life.[A]
Say, why don't you teach me to
attack more accurately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]...Oh well. He saved my life,
so there's that, I guess...[A]
[0356]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSin][.....][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][ToggleSmile]Sin!
Behind you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Are you all right?[A]
I guess even you have some
trouble when surrounded.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You didn't have to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't help it.
I acted without thinking.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll be going now.[A]
Just make sure you don't start
shooting at me again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't make
that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You sure did before![A]
...Well, we're in battle, so I don't blame
you for making mistakes now and again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm not stupid enough to point
my bow at an ally.[A]
...I will never shoot you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll be right behind you.
Leave the enemies you miss to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I will![A]
[0357]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sue?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I must apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For not getting all of our
clansmen to safety?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]There was a traitor among us.
There was nothing you could do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps, but I am responsible. I am
the granddaughter of the Silver Wolf.[A]
It was my duty to lead our clansmen to
safety, no matter the circumstances.[A]
But I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was I who gave you those orders.
It was my responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you abandon your fellow
clansmen and flee on your own?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Never![A]
When the enemy appeared, I rushed at them
to make time for our people to escape.[A]
But it was a decoy...[A]
The enemy's main forces were stationed
exactly where everyone fled...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then you performed admirably.[A]
I'm sure you won't forget it so
easily, but you must accept it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I'll try.[A]
[0358]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSue][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Sue, are you feeling
better now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I see it still torments you.[A]
I suppose you wouldn't get
over it that easily...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I just let
our people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sue, let's go out for a
long ride after this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A long ride?
In a time like this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, absolutely.[A]
You could run to your death
with an occupied mind.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You must listen more carefully to the
voices of the Sky and the Earth.[A]
We humans are mere ants when compared
to their grandeur.[A]
Haven't I always told you this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I am listening
to them...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, you listen only
to your own voice.[A]
We ride after this
battle.[A]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'll do as you say.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
[0359]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadSue][OpenMidLeft]
You look much
better, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I feel better.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll never forget how I failed
to rescue our clansmen,[A]
but I've decided not to dwell
on the past.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll look towards
the future.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It seems that you learned something
from our ride.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was able to listen to
nature's voices again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good![A]
[ToggleSmile]I couldn't stand seeing you
so distressed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never showed it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps the others couldn't
see, but I could.[A]
I'm your grandfather. I've known you
since the moment you were born.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grandfather...
I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was only doing my duty...
as your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
[035A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
All right, where's
the next enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hm?
[ToggleSmile]Do you need something, Sue?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You use a bow, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why don't you
ride a horse?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've always fought like this.
On my feet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Isn't it hard to fight
on the ground?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not really.[A]
I mean, I think it would be harder
trying to shoot from horseback.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, Sue?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...What was that all about?[A]
[035B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wolt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, hi, Sue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think it's better to
fight on horseback.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
...You mean with a bow?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
With a horse, it's easier to approach
and retreat from your target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, to each their own...[A]
Wait, did you try getting off your
horse and shooting from the ground?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I wanted to try it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have hurt yourself![A]
You can't try new ways of fighting
like that during a battle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it wasn't in battle.[A]
I just shot at some
trees near the camp.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]For what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you for being so
concerned about me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're allies,
right?[A]
[035C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSue][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wolt?[A]
What's the matter?
You're out of breath.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...It sure is tough trying to keep
up with a horse...[A]
I mean, I remember you said it was
easier to approach your target.[A]
So...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You tried it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought I may as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What did you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well, a horse's speed
is unbeatable.[A]
But still, I'm more
stable on foot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said it was dangerous to try
new ways of fighting in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh, I did, didn't I?[A]
I only tried it for a bit.
It's okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want the advantage of a horse's
speed, you can ride behind me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's all right with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I don't think you'll be able
to shoot very well, though...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shoot? I don't think I'd be able
to stay on, let alone shoot![A]
I think I'll stay on the ground.
It feels more natural to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.
That is probably for the best.[A]
[035D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder]
[OpenMidRight]Are you Dayan
the Silver Wolf?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You are not Sacaen, and
yet you know my name...[A]
How do you know of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I treated a wounded Sacaen
once in the past.[A]
It was then I heard of the
unrivaled warrior of Sacae.[A]
With a name like Silver Wolf,[A]
I expected someone with
white hair like mine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
The name Silver Wolf
comes from our history.[A]
Our legends say that our
ancestors were wolves.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I didn't know that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you need something from me?[A]
If you come to preach, I already
have deities I worship.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
No, I did not
come to preach.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Are you sure? Don't you need
to serve your gods?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course. My mission is to guide
those in need of direction.[A]
But you Sacaens already
worship the Sky and the Earth.[A]
The gods would not look fondly on
me for pushing my beliefs upon you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[035E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We Sacaens pray to the Sky and the Earth.[A]
The light of day and the darkness of night
that engulf the land...[A]
They produce wind, lightning, fire, ice,
and other affinities...[A]
Every person in this world is protected
by one of these elements.[A]
According to my clan's beliefs, I am
protected by the anima affinity.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Interesting that
you believe so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The St. Elimine Church has
similar beliefs.[A]
When the creators made man, all
mankind was blessed with an affinity.[A]
However...those elements...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Those elements hold no power
on their own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... Interesting indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Perhaps...[A]
Perhaps this is one of the
grand truths of the world.[A]
[035F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The seven affinities...[A]
Their effects only appear
through bonds with others.[A]
When your heart is linked
with someone else's...[A]
That is when the elements
reveal their true power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, precisely.[A]
Saint Elimine said to
cherish our relationships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I wonder if our hearts
have linked somehow.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am sure of it.[A]
Though who knows what
effect that may have...[A]
[0360]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...
What that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
Haven't you seen eastern bows before?
This is a bow we use for training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I can see?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right. Here.
Try pulling the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pull good?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're incredibly strong.[A]
A normal man wouldn't be able
to pull it at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now, try firing
this arrow...[A]
[OpenMidRight]H-huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, you put the
arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Put arrow here...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now let go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let go...[A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Ugh.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzalez!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Arrow hit me...[A]
[0361]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Let me see your head.
Yes... It looks better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uh...
No more bow.[A]
What that horse?
Strange color.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, it looks different from the
horses in your home, doesn't it?[A]
We use these horses as a way
of life in Sacae.[A]
We can also keep up with the mounts
that western knights ride upon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I want ride...[A][Clear]
Guh.[MoveFarFarRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzalez!
Are you all right?[A]
Horses are very sensitive to
people standing behind them.[A]
You have to be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Ow...
Horse kick me...[A]
[0362]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, Gonzalez.[A]
It seems that you get hurt
whenever you are with me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It OK.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here, I'll give you
this as an apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a headdress that we of the
Kutolah clan wear.[A]
It would suit a fine warrior
like you nicely.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I like.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take this as well.[A]
It's a wine made from horse milk.
We drink it at festivities.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I happy.
I drink.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait, don't...
drink so much...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
Uhwuhwuh?[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzalez!
Can you get up?[A]
This wine is very strong.[A]
You shouldn't drink so much
of it at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhwuhwuhhh...[A]
[0363]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're the Silver Wolf...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You are a warrior of Sacae.
What is your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
...I was at Bulgar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bulgar...[A]
You survived.[A]
I heard that most of the
people there were killed...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]That day...[A]
I learned that it is the strong
who consume the weak in nature.[A]
That is true anywhere, be it
Sacae...or Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then...is that the reason
you are here?[A]
To become strong and take
your revenge on Bern...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[0364]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
You fight for revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What will you do once
you have vengeance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I ask you once more...[A]
What do you plan to do
after avenging your clan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You don't need to know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you...dedicate your
life to revenge?[A]
Will you be happy with that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You want me to keep quiet, even
after seeing my entire clan killed?[A]
...You suffered the same as I
have. You must understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is not what I am saying.
We are men of Sacae.[A]
Those who desecrate our land
must pay.[A]
However...even if we do win this
war and destroy Bern,[A]
the deceased will never return.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Revenge will not bring back
that which you've lost.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I know no other
way to live.[A]
[0365]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDayan][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rutger.[A]
What will you do when the war is over?
Do you have a place to go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As I thought.[A]
Would you join
the Kutolah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Our clan lost its battle,
but its soul lives on.[A]
Once the war ends, we will gather
in the plains once more.[A]
I think you could be a great
help to us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't accept charity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not charity.[A]
I ask you because I have faith
in your strength as a warrior.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
Hm...
A difficult person, I see.[A]
Then I shall say no more.[A]
But remember that if you
ever change your mind,[A]
we will welcome you with
open arms.[A]
Whatever happens to you...
don't forget that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...I won't.[A]
[0366]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]
Barthe. I haven't thanked
you yet, have I?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanked me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You came to rescue me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, that.[A]
Such is my duty as a knight,
milady.[A]
If anything, I should apologize
that we didn't arrive sooner.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Barthe...
I'm sorry.[A]
I can never repay
you for that...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know. Here, take
this necklace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, please.[A]
We do not fight for
reward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You are safe.[A]
That in itself is
reward enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Barthe...[A]
[0367]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Barthe.[A]
Do you know what Debias
and Legance did?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
All I know is that they made contact
with Bern to start the rebellion.[A]
However, I have heard many other
troubling rumors about them as well.[A]
I hear they used their positions
to illegally seize money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The rebellion was in planning
before Bern even invaded.[A]
Astolfo found proof of that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...
I was foolish.[A]
They served my father so...
I didn't want to suspect them.[A]
I wanted to trust them simply
because they were our vassals.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But that trust is what
put you in danger...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, exactly...
I'm truly sorry, Barthe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina, your safety is the
most important thing of all.[A]
Without a master to whom we can
pledge our loyalty,[A]
we surely cannot be called
knights at all.[A]
[0368]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barthe...[A]
What do you think will happen
to Ostia without my father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone needs to rebuild it after the
war is over, or it will fall into chaos.[A]
That someone is you, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...I'm not sure I'm qualified.[A]
I'll only get in the way and keep
everyone from doing their jobs...[A]
You...must think so, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
I know not how those in power
should act, but...[A][Clear]
When you told me you wanted to
trust your vassals,[A]
I do not think you were mistaken.[A]
Indeed, you should have been able
to trust them above all others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
No matter the path you follow,
no matter how you doubt yourself,[A]
we true knights will always swear
our undying loyalty to you.[A]
[0369]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ogier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Barthe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you been keeping
up with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I've been wanting
to ask you.[A]
Why did you not
become a knight?[A]
Why did you become
a mercenary?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heavy armor doesn't
really suit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is simply because you don't
train yourself hard enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But, I mean,
I wasn't born with--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is a perfect opportunity.
I shall train you every day.[A]
I will make a knight of you yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
[036A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Barthe...
This training is just...crazy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll get used to it soon enough.[A]
I do it every day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I don't have the
build that you do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Was that a complaint
I heard just now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then keep quiet
and train harder.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir...[A]
[036B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
Are those practice
swings I hear...?[A]
[ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier]
[OpenMidRight]Whew...[A]
I wonder if I'm any closer
to Sir Barthe by now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe]Ogier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Whoa![A]
Oh, Sir Barthe!
You scared me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are doing well.
Excellent.[A]
Your body has gotten
used to the training.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel uncomfortable if
I'm not working my body.[A]
I'd hate to fail for lack
of training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you have learned your lesson.[A]
If you train yourself constantly,
you will never tire in battle.[A]
That holds true both for knights
like me and mercenaries like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Mercenaries like me?[A]
But I thought you wanted
to make me a knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I only said that to make you
train harder.[A]
I know your build can't
handle heavy armor.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It encouraged you,
didn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did it?[A]
I'd say it made me suffer
more than anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nothing...[A]
[036C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Barthe.
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You seem to have improved
a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There were many tough battles in
our journey from Lycia to Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, it's not as if I was just
sitting around in Ostia, either.[A]
I trained at the arena,
preparing for battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I remember that arena.[A]
I have to say, though...
I don't really approve of that.[A]
A knight, fighting for money?
It's almost a contradiction...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one has need of
a weak knight.[A]
I train myself to
prevail in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh. You haven't
changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither have you...oaf.[A]
[036D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Barthe...
Were you able to accept it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Accept what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not going into battle
alongside Lord Hector.[A]
You've always said that a
knight's purpose is to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I would certainly say I was
disappointed at first.[A]
But staying and protecting the castle
and Lady Lilina was its own battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's for sure...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But I allowed Lady Lilina to fall
into the hands of the enemy.[A]
That was my failure.
I was naive...[A]
Somewhere in my heart, I wanted
to believe that Ostia was secure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't blame yourself...
You always do that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's true. I do...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Whenever I talk to you, I always
seem to reveal my true feelings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]We've been friends ever since we
we were knighted.[A]
We couldn't hide something from
one another even if we tried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha...
You're right about that.[A]
[036E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors,
I always wanted to ask you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ask me what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why did you become
a knight?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because I want to protect
the ones I love.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Admirable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I became a knight because they
are the strongest fighters.[A]
I don't believe any can match a
knight in a one-on-one battle.[A]
...That's why I couldn't protect
Lady Lilina...[A]
We faced a whole army of armored
knights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Blaming yourself again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It only happened because I
wasn't strong enough.[A]
If I had enough power to stop
the rebellion myself,[A]
I could have contained the
situation.[A]
I must become stronger still.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Then become a lance
sharper than any other.[A]
And I shall be your
impervious shield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A lance and shield...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
An unstoppable lance and an
unbreakable shield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That sounds like a plan,
friend![A]
[036F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight]Sir Barthe!
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
Do you expect me to lose
to weaklings like these?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, never.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then I won't ask you
how you're doing.[A]
We knights of Ostia are
always at our peak.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I appreciate your concern for me,[A]
but worry about yourself before
you worry about others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir.[A]
[0370]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter, Gwendolyn?
You're panting.[A]
A knight of Ostia shouldn't be heaving
after a light battle like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I'm sorry, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember our training, Gwendolyn![A]
Remember how we sprint-marched
over that mountain.[A]
This is nothing compared
to that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Show the enemy...why they should
fear the knights of Ostia![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![A]
[0371]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight]Sir Barthe, how can I
improve myself further?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're a full-fledged
knight of Ostia now, Gwendolyn.[A]
I have no criticisms to
offer you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you, sir![A][ToggleSmile]
But...Sir Barthe...[A]
Anything will do.
Say anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Say anything?
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
I'm sure there is something
I could improve in...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
You must critique
yourself now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter?
Why do you look so discouraged?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I want you to
teach me more...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't...want you to
leave me, Sir Barthe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you
talking about?[A]
We fight together
as equals.[A]
I won't leave you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Truly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
...We can afford to waste no
more time talking like this.[A]
Let's move, Gwendolyn![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![A]
[0372]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It seems Bern was working behind the
scenes even before the war started.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. The traitors to the Lycian
League, the rebellion at Ostia...[A]
All according to their plan.[A]
Of course, I'm to blame for that.
I didn't realize soon enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The betrayals and
Lord Hector's death...[A]
We all share the blame.
It wasn't just you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nah, it was me.[A]
The mistakes I made...
They were just too egregious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...We must keep our eyes sharp so that
such a tragedy does not happen again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, traitors and spies
could be anywhere.[A]
Possibly even in
this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?![A]
You know of a traitor
in our ranks?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...no.[A]
But if I learned anything
from Lord Hector's death,[A]
it's that we can't be
too careful.[A]
[0373]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Astolfo...
About potential traitors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have any suspects?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not yet.
I'm looking into it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once you think about who might
be a traitor...[A]
any number of soldiers could betray
us for any number of reasons.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, we've got people
from just about everywhere.[A]
I'll have to go through them
individually, one by one...[A]
It won't be easy, I can tell
you that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The most obvious suspect
would be that princess...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Guinivere, princess of Bern. There is
something suspicious about her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy trusts her.
I don't want to think that she...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Still...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our comrades would lose all trust in us if they
found out we suspect them of betrayal...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]It's rough, isn't it?
But someone's got to do it.[A]
[0374]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBarthe][OpenMidRight][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Astolfo.
...How did the search go?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, about that.[A]
It took a while, but I feel confident
that there are no traitors.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Princess Guinivere genuinely trusts
Lord Roy. And so does everyone else.[A]
This ragtag group has a stronger
bond than you might think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good...
That's a relief.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh. So that's taken
care of.[A]
I'll keep an eye on any new
recruits who join up, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry to make you do
all the dirty work...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, don't let it bother you.
It's what I do.[A]
[0375]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
Has something been bothering
you lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?
No, I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure...?[A]
I was given special orders by Lord
Hector to protect you at all costs.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So?[A]
[OpenMidRight]So if something has happened, you should
tell me so I can protect you adequately...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I told you!
Nothing's wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight]B-but normally, milady, you aren't
quite this...touchy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Touchy?!
I'm not touchy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, milady, but--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Silence, Bors!
You're annoying me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-where are you going, milady?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someplace where I won't
have to listen to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Lilina![A]
[0376]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, erm...
about before...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Before?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You were just concerned for me,
and I blew up at you...[A]
I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please...don't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Will you hear why
I'm so irritable?[A]
I think I need
someone to talk to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]If I may,
then of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's about Roy...
What do you think about him?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I think he has grown splendidly into
a wise and caring leader to us all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But the Roy I know had
mismatched buttons on his suit,[A]
and he couldn't do even one
step of a dance...[A]
I always thought I had to
take care of him.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]But Roy's suddenly changed.
He's gotten so...grown up, you know?[A]
He seems so far away now...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Milady, Lord Roy has not
changed as much as you think.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He has certainly matured, but his
nature is still the same.[A]
Lord Roy is still the same person
you know him to be within.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you're right...[A]
Thank you for lending me
your ear, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, milady.[A]
[0377]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidRight]You look much better
today, milady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I feel much better, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is good to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not as if Roy was avoiding
me or anything...[A]
It's just that he seemed to be changing,
and I felt I was left behind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I jumped to conclusions and
fretted over nothing...[A]
Once I realized that, it
suddenly seemed so silly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm still a child, aren't I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors, will you stay
by my side?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I am a knight, and my
loyalty lies with you.[A]
I shall always be at your
side, ready to serve.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Bors...[A]
[0378]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-oh! Hello, Gwendolyn.[A]
What a...uh...coincidence![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is good to see you well.
Do you need something, Brother?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...I don't.[A]
I was just walking around
and I ran into you. Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you hurt? Your armor
isn't too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I am fine, Brother.
I must be off, though...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Leaving already?
You could rest a bit longer...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you for your consideration,
but this is a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, of course...
Take care.[A]
[0379]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Gwendolyn...[A]
Running in to you like this...
Pure coincidence, yet again...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something...wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, no, it's nothing.[A]
Why don't we talk a
little, though?[A]
You're not hurt?
Your armor's not too heavy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.
Thanks for the concern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you taking care of
your lance and helmet?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you eating properly?[A]
Do you have any worries that
you want to talk about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you made any friends?[A]
Any boyfriends I should
know about...?[A]
[037A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadBors]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]G-Gwendolyn! We certainly
meet a lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Brother.
Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, nothing.
Just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am truly grateful for
your concern.[A]
But I am a knight of Ostia.[A]
I'm training myself so I
can be like you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]If I'm to become strong, I can't
depend upon you all the time.[A]
I'm fine, really, so please
don't worry...[A]
...I'm grateful to have a
brother like you.[A]
But if you'll excuse me.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Dear me...
She's grown so much.[A]
I suppose I was being
childish...[A][Clear]
Gwendolyn, I wish you luck.[A]
[037B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidLeft]Heya, Bors.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Astolfo...
Is something the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, it's nothing.
I just wanted to say hi.[A]
Ha ha ha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]That smell...
Have you been drinking?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe a little. I was bored
so I decided to have a swig...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Bored? This is the
middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, all I can do is open
chests and doors anyway...[A]
Not like I can fight or do
anything worthwhile.[A]
I'll get out of your hair so
you can get back to fighting...[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[037C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, Bors.
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Astolfo...[A]
I think you should refrain
from...imbibing as you do.[A]
The younger recruits are watching,
and you're setting a bad example.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Bors...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry...
about Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
I knew there was a traitor
to the Lycian League...[A]
If I'd done my job properly,
we wouldn't be in this state...[A]
Lord Hector wouldn't have
lost...if I'd...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]That was not
your fault.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
And, you know...
The rebellion.[A]
It should have
been obvious...[A]
But I couldn't do
anything about it...[A]
Heh, I'm just a
worthless sack...[A]
You must really
hate me...[A]
I'm a joke of a
spy...[A]
Ha ha...ha...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Rats...
I'm out of sauce...[A]
[037D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Astolfo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh...?
Oh, Bors.[A]
Come have a drink
with me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop blaming yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We lost Lord Hector. The
responsibility lies in all of us.[A]
But...still...we must not dwell
on the past.[A]
We must look forward.[A]
We must do as Lord Hector would
have wanted.[A]
We need you, Astolfo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Why?[A]
Why are you...defending a
useless wretch like me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because you are a
knight of Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A knight?
Who...? Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You may not have been
knighted...[A]
But you put your life on
the line for Lord Hector.[A]
That is more than enough
to make you a knight.[A]
At least, I think so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Bors...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Astolfo, let us move forward...
and make our master proud.[A]
[037E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight]
Sir Bors? You are Sir Bors,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Ogier of the Ostian knights.
I heard about you from Gwendolyn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, my sister... So you're
our newest recruit?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. I'm pleased
to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I wish I could say the same...
but you don't look like a knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, well, I try to fill in the gaps
that our squad falls short in.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see.
Most admirable.[A]
Not everyone has
that ability.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, sir.[A]
[037F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I heard from Sir Barthe that you
beat him once in combat.[A]
Is that true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I did.[A]
It was just once, in a great
tournament held in Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What was the battle like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To tell the truth, I actually
don't remember it very well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
The battle with Sir Barthe was so
boring that you forgot about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, no, nothing of that sort.[A]
It was because I don't like to
fight for the sake of fighting.[A]
I didn't want to join so I had
no interest in the tournament.[A]
I've forgotten most of what
happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Ogier, you must always
fight for a cause.[A]
You must never fight simply
for the sake of fighting.[A]
[0380]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBors][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight]Sir Bors, you said that one must
always have a cause to fight for.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Indeed I did.[A]
You must be willing to go through any
and all hardships for that cause.[A]
Do you have such a purpose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately, I don't.[A]
I only became a mercenary
to feed my family.[A]
So I don't really have
a cause...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got one right there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Feeding your family is a
noble cause.[A]
Train yourself to become stronger,
all for your family.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, sir, I will![A]
[OpenMidLeft]A cause isn't limited to defending
your country or saving the world.[A]
If you understand that, then you
will fight with the best.[A]
[0381]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn]
[OpenMidLeft]Hello, Gwendolyn.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina...
Please stay close to me.[A]
I shall protect you
with my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Th-thank you...[A]
That armor... It's quite a
feat that you can wear it.[A]
Isn't it heavy for someone
of your build?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, milady.[A]
The weight of a knight's armor
is the symbol of their loyalty.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right...
Just don't strain yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you very much,
milady.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why did you become a knight?
Did you want to be like Bors?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes... I want to be
just like my brother.[A]
I wish to protect
you as he does.[A]
[0382]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidLeft]Gwendolyn.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's chat a bit.
Tell me about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, milady.[A]
I am a knight of Ostia
and I serve--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I know that...
I meant more interesting things.[A]
For example, are there any men
you fancy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M...men?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...don't really know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've always been focused on becoming
strong like my brother, so...[A]
I've never really thought about
things like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's talk about something
else then.[A]
We're in this together and we
grew up in the same land.[A]
Plus, we're both girls.[A]
I want to get to know
you better.[A]
[0383]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina,
you are an odd individual.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Odd?
How so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are in a much higher position
than I...[A]
Yet you still chat lightly to me
with a smile on your face.[A]
It seems...odd.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Do you think so? I just want
to be friends with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]F-friends?[A]
I don't think that would be
appropriate, milady...[A]
You are my mistress![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That doesn't matter.[A]
You're the only girl around
my age from Ostia.[A]
Let's not worry about positions
like mistress or vassal...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina![A]
You carry Ostia's future
on your shoulders.[A]
You are different from us.[A]
You do understand that,
don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...So we can't be friends?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, though I am very
grateful for your consideration.[A]
Perhaps we cannot be friends,[A]
but I would enjoy chatting with
you once in a while as before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
...Thank you, Gwendolyn.[A]
[0384]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight]What are you doing,
Gwendolyn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm practicing my walking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Walking?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For us knights, it's tough to get
back up if we fall to the ground.[A]
We have to build strong legs to
ensure that we never fall.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The basics are everything, Ogier.[A]
[0385]
[OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yah! Yah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn]Ogier, are you practicing
your sword swings?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That I am.[A]
I can't let you get ahead of me,[A]
so I thought I'd practice
the basics, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's good.[A]
But it'll take a lot
of work to beat me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose we've got a little
competition going, then![A]
[0386]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight]How are you doing,
Gwendolyn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perfectly fine, of course.[A]
A strong knight can't
complain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me neither. Not if I want to
be a powerful mercenary...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thank you, Ogier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]F-for what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Our competition has kept
me working hard.[A]
I'd have probably given up
by now if not for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I feel the same way.[A]
I've been able to come
so far thanks to you.[A]
We're evenly matched.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I agree.[A]
But I'll never let
you get ahead of me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right back at you,
Gwendolyn![A]
[0387]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Astolfo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? Oh...
You're Bors' younger sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you doing back here?[A]
You have light gear.
You should be well ahead of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... Yeah, sorry.[A]
This leg doesn't work
the way it used to...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Sir Astolfo, just how
old are you?[A]
Perhaps you should retire
if your body can't keep up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're even more austere
than your brother.[A]
...And you have the same
physical build, too.[A]
A girl your age should
really watch her weight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't have a weight problem!
This is my armor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, OK, sure.
Just calm down...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I think you could learn a
thing or two from my brother.[A]
[0388]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Astolfo![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Gwendolyn.
How's it going?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Sir Astolfo...[A]
You can't sit here and
rest like this...[A]
This is a battlefield!
It's serious![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the point in getting
fired up over nothing?[A]
Relax. Why don't you join me?
Take your shoes off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
I won't let this slide.[A]
You leave me no choice! I'll
have to drag you to battle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey there...
Slow down...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Astolfo...
That wound...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh... This?
It's just an old scar.[A]
This leg is pretty useless
because of it, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]When...did you get that wound?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm... A long time ago.[A]
I messed up on a reconnaissance
mission in Castle Bern.[A]
I did get away though, so it's
like a trophy to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...[A]
I'm sorry!
I didn't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, whatever.
Don't worry about it...[A]
[0389]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadGwendolyn][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Astolfo![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Gwendolyn. Come to grace
me with your beauty?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will not be swayed by flattery.
I know your leg slows you down.[A]
But! You have other habits that
are not excusable![A]
First, you imbibe far more than
is acceptable...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh, brother...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will not let you laze
about as you do.[A]
You must behave like a
proper Ostian knight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, whatever...[A]
[038A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin...![A]
What's wrong?!
Your eyes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That voice...
Is that you, Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You cannot see, Your Highness?
I thought your eyes had recovered...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still go blind for
a while sometimes...[A]
I will be fine once
I rest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I heard that the poison rendered
you blind for several months...[A]
Forgive me, my prince...[A]
If only I had been on guard, you would
never have suffered this fate...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I wonder how...
my father is doing.[A]
Is he any better?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I regret to say that he
is not, Your Highness.[A]
He does not know that
you yet live.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]But I am sure he will be rejuvenized
once you return to the palace.[A]
He will recover...and so will
our nation.[A]
[038B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My prince,[A]
General Roy's tactics are upsetting
the balance of power on the continent.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes... So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It will not be long before this army
conquers the entirety of Elibe.[A]
I believe that will be the ideal time to
announce your return to the throne...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas...
Regarding that matter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Prince Myrddin?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have hesitations about
returning to Etruria...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you saying?![A]
Everyone would be so
delighted to see you safe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Douglas.[A]
I learned much in my time with the
resistance in the Western Isles.[A]
Too much, in fact.[A]
I witnessed innocents treated like
animals under corrupt Etrurian lords.[A]
If not for the attempt on my life,
I probably would never have known.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That is all the more reason to return.
You can rid us of such atrocities...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I promise I will return to
the palace someday.[A]
But for now...[A]
I want to be with the people.
They need my protection.[A]
[038C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Myrddin...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me that...
I am but a simple bard here.[A]
I am not your prince,
and you are not my general.[A]
You can accept that for
the time being, can't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If I must.[A]
In that case, I pledge my loyalty not
as your general, but as a dear friend.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You are as
unbending as ever.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My unwavering will
is my strength.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This war will end soon.[A]
General Roy may be young,
but he understands the people.[A]
He will lead the whole continent
to a gilded age of peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I concur.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's my duty to serve the people
as well, however.[A]
I don't intend to lax in my
own duties.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall be at your side
no matter where you go.[A]
[038D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Geese.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey...
Long time no see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to thank you for
what you've done.[A]
I understand that you safely
escorted Pr--[A]
I mean, Elffin to the
Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I did what I could.[A]
That bard was an interesting guy.[A]
The girl he came with was seasick
the whole time, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...
Geese, I must apologize.[A]
I misjudged you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The assassins were still after Elffin,
so I couldn't put him on a large ship.[A]
He would have been found immediately.[A]
You were my only option.[A]
But being a pirate, I didn't
trust you completely.[A]
Even so, you kept your word.
For that, I thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure...
No problem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You could have turned him over to the
revolutionaries for a hefty reward.[A]
Why did you choose to help him?[A]
It didn't make you much money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, helping people makes
me feel warm and fuzzy inside.[A]
I sure can't say the same
thing about piracy.[A]
[038E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese, I feel I must
reward you somehow.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Reward me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You saved our
country.[A]
I will give you
anything you ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous... I already got
the payment you promised me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No... That paltry sum doesn't
suffice for what you've done.[A]
You are a hero to the
Etrurian people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a hero? What are you on about?
The guy's just a bard.[A]
I mean, I guess he ended up
liberating the Western Isles, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese... There is
something you should know...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry.
I cannot tell you now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeesh...
Way to leave me hanging.[A]
[OpenMidRight]In any case...[A]
I hear that you helped the people
living in the Isles as well.[A]
Our king and prince had
wished them to be free.[A]
You did our nation a
great service.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I hate to burst your bubble...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I don't care about politics or
nations or any of that in the least.[A]
I just wanted to pay the villagers
back for helping me out.[A]
[038F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're just not gonna
leave me be, are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Absolutely not.
You have done me a great favor.[A]
It would be a dishonor on my
name if I didn't return it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You knights are so hard-headed.[A]
I swear, if you found a coin lying
in the street,[A]
you'd leave it out of honor or
loyalty or some nonsense.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Geese...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh...
Fine, let me think...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...All right, here's what I want.[A]
I want you and your king to
run a good country.[A]
Don't go around causing
pointless wars.[A]
And make sure people can travel
and do business safely.[A]
I'm gonna go bankrupt if you
don't do that for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Geese...[A]
You deserve better than the
life of a pirate.[A]
I swear on my life that
I will fulfill your requests![A]
[0390]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excuse me.[A]
Are you Lord Douglas
of Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that is me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you are the
Great General?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am but a simple
soldier now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that so...[A]
I am Igrene,
Guardian of Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nabata...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I fend off invaders
in the desert heat.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Quite a job you have.[A]
Do you need something
from me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want you to promise me that
you will never attack Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I cannot promise you that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am a knight...[A]
If the king orders an
attack, I must obey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even if you know
it to be wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Such is a
knight's duty.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[0391]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Douglas,
about our conversation before...[A]
Can you at least assure me that your
nation has no reason to attack Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You already have so much wealth...
Why is that so unreasonable?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Attacks can be ordered
even without the king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria is a large nation governed by
various families of nobility.[A]
Not all nobles are kind at heart.[A]
If such nobles took over the court,
there is nothing the king or I could do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what is there to gain
from a desert like Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not about gold for such people...
They simply enjoy showing their power.[A]
They feel no worth unless they are
stepping upon another.[A]
I understand that the people in the
Western Isles suffered such abuse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[0392]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it,
Lord Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I have already said this, but in my
position, I cannot promise what you ask.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, I will do my utmost to ensure
the likelihood of an attack is minimized.[A]
I shall spread word that a warrior of Nabata
was among the heroes who rescued the king.[A]
I will do all I can to persuade the nobles
never to disturb your peace in Arcadia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I shall remember
those words.[A]
I suppose I can ask
no more of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[A]
[0393]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]General Douglas![A]
[OpenMidRight]Perceval.
We fight together once more.[A]
And yet I cannot erase the
shame I brought upon myself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please, General Douglas.[A]
It was your duty as
a general.[A]
You have nothing to
be ashamed of.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I am honored to be able to
fight by your side again.[A]
I'm sure the other Etrurians
with us feel the same way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you...[A]
Your words are
encouraging.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let us fight for the
future of Etruria![A]
[0394]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Perceval.
How do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been better.[A]
How about you,
General Douglas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am fighting my hardest, but...[A]
It seems I have lost the strength
I once had.[A]
I suppose no man can beat age.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nonsense.[A]
You more than live up to
the title of Great General.[A]
You have quite some fight
in you yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is something
troubling you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, pay it no mind...[A]
[0395]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Perceval.[A]
Perhaps it's a bit soon
to say so, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am considering stepping down as
Great General after this war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
That would leave the highest position
in the Etrurian military empty![A]
[OpenMidRight]I think not...
I want you to take my place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am still so young, General Douglas.
I cannot assume such a position...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think yourself young?
What of our commander, Roy?[A]
He is much younger than you,
yet he leads all of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]The youth will have no room to grow
if the old hang onto their positions.[A]
Perceval, you are brilliant, strong
and a natural leader.[A]
Once the prince returns, the king
will abdicate the throne anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]General Douglas![A]
Those in service are forbidden to speak
of the inheritance of the throne...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is no matter.[A]
I have served the king for decades.
I know him better than any.[A]
Once he learns of the prince's survival,
I am certain he will give him the throne.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We must rebuild Etruria
alongside our new king.[A]
Etruria will be born again
under the care of the youth.[A]
I am counting on you,
Perceval.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I won't disappoint you.[A]
[0396]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I knew you were alive, but I never
heard that you were here with us.[A]
Why didn't you tell me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I fight in shame.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nonsense!
You are an asset to us all.[A]
It is an honor to fight
alongside you once again.[A]
Together we can show everyone why the
Etrurian Generals are so respected![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
It's not like you to be
in such cheer, Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's only because you're
here fighting with me.[A]
I've always idolized you, if
you want to know the truth.[A]
[0397]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The former Mage General appointed
you as his successor...[A]
But many were opposed to you
taking the position at first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that is true.[A]
A female officer was enough to
incite the rage of some.[A]
I spent most of my earlier days
fighting against prejudice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To be honest, I doubted your
abilities at first, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.[A]
Every time you told me I was
too weak for the job,[A]
I would bury myself in spell
tomes and work even harder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's just like you.[A]
I expect you must have
resented me quite a bit.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
I never resented
you, General.[A]
Do you know why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. Please tell me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The day I enlisted, the other young officers
gave me a hard time for being a woman.[A]
But you defended me. You said that I
was stronger than any of them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm afraid I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's all right.
I remember it perfectly.[A]
[0398]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, General?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I must thank you.[A]
You've given an old,
decrepit soldier hope.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
What do you...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can feel my age whenever
I fight.[A]
An elderly soldier is of
no use. My time has come.[A]
It is up to you to lead
Etruria to a brighter tomorrow.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I've never heard such foolish words
from your mouth, General.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]A brighter tomorrow for Etruria?
The war has yet to be won.[A]
And even if we are victorious,
we still have much to do.[A]
We must rebuild our land and regain
the trust of other nations.[A]
Etruria's future comes after
everything has been settled.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And you're going to place that
burden upon us as you retire?[A]
I won't allow it, General.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You really have grown
more confident.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is thanks to you.[A]
Now, why don't you find some use
instead of moping about your age?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... Very well.[A]
You amateurs are no match for
me as long as I still stand.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm hm hm...
That's better, General.[A]
[0399]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There you are, Larum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father![A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I mean, Lord Douglas![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry. We don't need to keep our
relationship a secret from these people.[A]
We don't have many chances to speak
like this.[A]
Just call me Father, as you always do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Father...[A]
You don't look well.[A]
Are you OK?
Do you feel sick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not sick.
I'm just a little tired.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can I help?[A]
If there's anything
at all, Father...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Larum...
It's all right.[A]
I feel better already
after seeing your face.[A]
You can go now...
There's no need for concern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Father...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight]Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Larum?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I brought you my special protein
lunch to help keep up your energy![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, thank you, Larum.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tee hee...
Go on! Eat up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What, right here?[A]
A general shouldn't sit down for a
meal in the middle of a battle...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I'm sorry![A]
O-of course... It's OK.[A]
I should have known better...
I'm...so stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Well, I'll make an
exception for you.[A]
I don't want it to go
cold, after all.[A]
I changed my mind.
I'll eat it now.[A][Clear]
...Mmm![A]
This looks good.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-it's OK, Father!
Don't force yourself![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, truly, it's delicious!
Mmm... Yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I envy your future husband
and children.[A]
They'll get to eat your
delicious food every day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Father![A]
[039B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDouglas][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight]Father!
Father![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Larum?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've finally found a way to
really cheer you up![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Larum...[A]
It's the thought that counts.
Your consideration is enough.[A]
Don't worry your little head
over it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not worrying![A]
It's just, if you look sad,
then I feel down, too.[A]
But if you laugh,
then I feel happy![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Larum...
You're a wonderful daughter.[A]
I'm so proud of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And who made me who I am?
You, silly![A]
You took me up off the street and
treated me like your own daughter.[A]
I...[A]
I've actually been happy with who
I am since you adopted me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Larum...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh![A]
Father, you're getting
all teary-eyed again![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh dear, you're right...
I must control my emotions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]OK, let me cheer you up
with my latest dance![A]
[039C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.
What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have something
to ask of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do?
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please, could you...teach me
how to use a sword?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
May I ask why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can only use bows.[A]
An archer can't even defend
himself at close range.[A]
I won't be able to protect
Lord Roy if something happens...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not belittle the bow.[A]
It has many traits that
close range weapons do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Even so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Besides, what is the point in learning
swordplay at your late age?[A]
A mediocre skill would be nothing
but a hindrance to Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do not worry yourself
about it any further.[A]
You are a great help to
Lord Roy as you are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I hope so...[A]
[039D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
I can tell by your face that you still
want me to teach you swordplay.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just don't understand.[A]
Am I really that much
help to Lord Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...[A]
Tell me what you think of the knights
like me who served Lord Eliwood.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...well...[A]
You're all really strong
and I look up to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, thank you for that.[A]
But there was one problem with
Lord Eliwood's knights.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There was?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of us are even
close to him in age.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Now that you mention it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood's vassals...[A]
They were all old like me or too
young for him to relate to.[A]
He couldn't speak to us on a
comfortable level.[A]
In a way, he was isolated.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never even thought
about that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't want Lord Roy to suffer the
same fate.[A]
You and Lord Roy are the same age, and
what's more, you were raised together.[A]
I need you to stay by Lord Roy's
side and give him moral support.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Moral support?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Combat prowess is important, but
that is not all you can do.[A]
Think on what I've said. You are
more important than you realize.[A]
[039E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Wolt.
You look better.[A]
Do you still want me to teach
you how to wield a sword?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No. After hearing your words, I
lost any sense of hesitation.[A]
I will perfect my skills with the bow
and ensure Lord Roy can count on me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]
Then it appears I can let
you take over for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? B-but if
you leave now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, no, I won't retire right at
this moment.[A]
Still, the day isn't far off.[A]
Once I am gone, you must take
care of Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you embarrassed to take
over for an old man like me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not at all...[A]
It's just...do you really
think I can do it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There's your problem.
You lack confidence.[A]
Lord Roy won't be able to turn
to you if you're like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can do it.
All you need is confidence![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Whew...
Ah, Wolt.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're sweating so profusely...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I'm fine.[A]
I was just doing some practice
swings with my sword.[A]
I'm still weak. I must train
myself further.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...we're in the
middle of a battle.[A]
Shouldn't you be saving your energy
for an emergency, Sir Alen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Silence!

Let's go, Wolt!
Don't lag behind![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Wha--?

[OpenMidLeft]Ah...huff...Wolt...[A]
Good to...huff...see
you...huff...again...[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-must you train so hard
in battle?[A]
The enemy won't have much left
to fight if you're like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe I'm crazy...but yes,
I have to do it.[A]
The continent feels bigger and
bigger the more we fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Who knows what we
may be up against next?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We must break through our own
limits and become stronger.[A]
We must be able to stand against
any so we can protect Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right...
I've caught my breath.[A]
Let's go![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]He's amazing...[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Are you training now, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, well, after seeing you, I couldn't
just sit around doing nothing.[A]
I have to become strong to protect
Lord Roy as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There you go.
That's the spirit![A]
Become strong, and
surprise even Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
Sorry, I was thinking
some things over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Have I disturbed you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I understand now.
Everything is fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you need something,
Wolt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I want to watch
you fight.[A]
Teach me to fight like you,
so I can protect Lord Roy![A]
[03A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadWolt][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Lance?
What are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Wolt.[A]
I am keeping a record
of this battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A record?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes. There is a quote from
one of my favorite books.[A]
"Information is the most
powerful weapon in any battle."[A]
And so, I keep track of our allies
and enemies and what goes on where.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In the battles ahead, one mistake
could lead to our doom.[A]
I must pay heed to every aspect
of battle for Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-you're right![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's time.
I must be off.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Amazing...
I should do like him![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Wolt...
Are you all right?[A]
Your eyes look
rather red...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes! I'm fine.[A]
I was just reading the book
on tactics that you lent me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's good. Were you up
reading it all night?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually, yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right. You might be interested in

detail over 24 volumes.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]After studying it, you should
master the basics fairly easily.[A]
After that, we can go into more
advanced details...[A][Clear]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where were you, Brother Saul?[A]
You always wander off
without saying anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not "wandering off",
Dorothy.[A]
I was diligently spreading word of our
church at the villages on the way here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Somehow I don't think you
were doing your job.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be ridiculous.[A]
I found a young maiden being
harassed by a very rude man.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You mean yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, Dorothy, have some
faith in me.[A]
Anyway, I drove the man off
and rescued the maiden.[A]
I acted exactly as a holy
man ought to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really? You're not exactly
very strong.[A]
How did you do it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I went to the man and clung
to him, crying,[A]
"I thought we loved each other!
Why do you reject me?!"[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[OpenMidLeft]What is it, Dorothy?[A]
Can't I have a single moment

[OpenMidRight]Oh no, you're not brushing me
away this time.[A]
I heard what you've been
up to.[A]
You've been flirting with
every girl in this army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There is a misunderstanding.[A]
I was just trying to spread
the love of the gods...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm not accepting
that again![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've heard that excuse before.

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Very well. Wait a moment
while I think of a new one.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's the point of that?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Dorothy, why are you
so upset?[A]
This is nothing new.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's exactly the problem![A]
People will misjudge the church
if they see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am insulted! I do my job
properly, Dorothy.[A]
Or haven't you noticed the sharp
increase in our female followers?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't you understand? If you're
just flirting with everyone...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Understand what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Enough of this![A]

[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I am sorry...[A]
I am sorry I...never

[OpenMidRight]...Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand perfectly now.[A]
You dislike my flirting because
I've always left you out of it.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Dorothy, I never knew that you
had such strong feelings for me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, er, um...

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How did that sound, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Wh-what?[A]

best excuse I could come up with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft]V-violence is not a solution,

[OpenMidLeft]I'm fine.
It didn't even touch me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I...
I'm so sorry![A]
[OpenMidLeft]There's no need to apologize.[A]
Things like this often happen
on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even if I was hit by your arrow,
I would share the blame.[A]
After all, it's my responsibility
to be aware of my surroundings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Never let your mind wander in battle.
That is a rule.[A]
Just don't be too upset about it.
All right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, I understand.[A]
I'm probably just being a nuisance
by apologizing over and over.[A]
I'll try harder next time![A]
[03A9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That last shot was just luck...[A]

[OpenMidRight]Y-yes, thank you![A]
I sometimes make mistakes like before,[A]
so I thought I should train myself so
I'll be more than just a hindrance...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good...[A]
Dorothy, I've been
thinking.[A]
You should relax more
when you shoot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh...?[A]
You were watching
how I fight?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I always try to watch and
understand how my comrades fight.[A]
I was waiting for a chance to
tell you,[A]
but I can see that you tend to
panic when you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that's true...[A]
I get scared in real battles, and
I can't move the way I want to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...There is no need for archers to come
out front. Stay back and cover for us.[A]
You must tell yourself that there
is nothing to be afraid of.[A]
We will defend the front lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Good thinking![A]
[03AA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy]...Yes![A]
Yes, that
was great![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][ToggleSmile]You seem to have improved,
Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Perceval![A]
I'm trying to relax when
I shoot, as you said.[A]
I think...I think I'm
getting better at it![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew you had talent.[A]
It was just a matter of getting
your confidence together,[A]
and now that you have, you'll
keep improving more and more.[A] 
[OpenMidRight]I can relax when I think that the others
are defending the front lines...[A]
I'm surprised how safe I can feel on
the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but that is the same for us up
front as well.[A]
We would not be able to charge in
without support from the back lines.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Am I useful to you too,

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you're helping me out
a great deal.[A]
I look forward to your

What is the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you know why I can't
use healing staves?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to help injured people by using
staves like you and Brother Saul.[A]
I've been praying every day, and I
think I've been faithful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you have. Your faith is
an example to us all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But I still can't help the injured...
I want to heal them, but I can't.[A]
Will I never have that power?
Am I unworthy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that's not it at all.[A]
Do you know the story of the
owl and the eagle, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I don't.[A]
Please tell it to me,
Father Yoder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is a story of when Saint
Elimine still walked the Earth.[A]
One day, during Saint Elimine's
journeys,[A]
an owl approached her from
the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The owl said to her,[A]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"[A]
Saint Elimine thought for a
moment, and replied,[A]
"The gods' domain lies high
above the clouds.[A]
Your wings are not strong
enough to take you there."[A]
The owl, disappointed,
returned to the forest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Poor owl...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A]
We shall continue the
story some other time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Some other time?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Remember the teachings of
Saint Elimine.[A]
Do not try to understand things
too quickly.[A]
You must ponder on what you are told
and develop your own thoughts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Right.[A]
Then please continue the story
another time, Father Yoder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, Dorothy.
I promise you I will.[A]
[03AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...After parting with the owl, Saint
Elimine continued on her journey.[A]
The next day, an eagle swooped
down from the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The eagle said to her,[A]
"I wish to go to the land of gods.
Would you show me the way?"[A]
Saint Elimine thought for
a moment, and replied,[A]
"The gods' domain lies in a
distant land beyond the night.[A]
Your eyes will not be able
to guide you through the dark."[A]
The eagle, disappointed,
returned to the mountain.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]However, the sympathetic and kind Saint
Elimine could not ignore the two birds.[A]
She went back, and brought the owl
and eagle together.[A]
She then told them,
"Journey to the land of gods together."[A]
[OpenMidRight]Together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. The two birds traveled
to the gods' land together.[A]
The eagle used his powerful wings
to carry the owl,[A]
and the owl used his great eyes to
guide the eagle through the night.[A]
Together, they were able to reach
the gods' domain.[A]
That is the end of the story.
Do you understand it, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
Sort of.[A]
[03AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadDorothy][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Yoder![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Dorothy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About that story...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought about it, but...
I'm not very smart...[A]
So I still don't get it...[A]
I sort of have an idea of what
it might be about, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then you have an answer, Dorothy.[A]
A story is just a story.
It has no definite meaning.[A]
Each person interprets a story and
comes up with their own answers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, good.[A]
I think I feel better now,
Father Yoder.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you?
Very good, Dorothy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what did Saint Elimine
do after that?[A]
Are there more stories?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, the journey of Saint Elimine
was a long one.[A]
The next day when Saint Elimine
continued on her travels...[A]
[03AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein]General Perceval!
It is good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.
I am glad to see you well.[A]
It appears you've adjusted well
to the position of commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I think I have.[A]
Though I am one of the least
experienced in the army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From the way I see it, those
serving under you are lucky.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hope so,
General Perceval.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you think
of all this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you think
about this army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Frankly, I feel more at home
here than in the Etrurian army.[A]
Perhaps it is because of
General Roy...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How do you feel,
General Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't feel completely
comfortable here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think what I seek from
an army doesn't exist here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying you can't get
used to this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, not quite.[A]
It is simply that I am, and will
always be, a knight of Etruria.[A]
It is difficult for me to serve
any master but my homeland.[A]
[03AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...How do you feel about the
revolution in Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I understand Bern was pulling strings
behind the scenes, but still...[A]
I never could have imagined the court
would divide so violently.[A]
To tell the truth, it's still
difficult for me to accept.[A]
I...I never thought that greed ruled
the minds of so many people...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria had not known war for
a very long time.[A]
Thus, blinded by peace, we paid no
heed to the scheming traitors.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... A conflict would have broken
out even without Bern's help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once this war is over, I will
devote my life to rebuilding Etruria.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, General Perceval.[A]
I am prepared to give my life for
that cause as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein, I want you to
seek a different path.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Once I return to Etruria, I plan to
dismiss all but a few.[A]
The few I have absolute trust in
to stay loyal to the king and country.[A]
It is what must be done to maintain trust
among the king's vassals.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Perceval...
Don't be ridiculous![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Klein...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Please, think on it a
little more.[A][ToggleSmile]
With your ability, you won't have
to go to such extreme measures.[A]
I've been holding this in because
we are at war, but I will no longer.[A]
I miss the days when I could look
up to you as an older brother.[A]
The days when we were more relaxed,
and when we laughed together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Once this war ends,[A]
let us celebrate the prosperity
of the new Kingdom of Etruria...[A]
Together, and in laughter.[A]
[03B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight]General Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I just noticed you, so
I thought I should say hello...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, hello to you, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you know, I've been thinking...[A]
Before the revolution, we never
worked together like this.[A]
But look at us now.[A]
We fight together, not under the
Etrurian banner, but General Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm. Yes...
Fate works in strange ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, indeed.[A]
Oh, to change the subject...[A]
Do you still like the same
foods as before?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? ...Yes, I think so.
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's just that the cook is a
little worried.[A]
He says that you are expressionless
no matter what you eat.[A]
He never knows what to give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Expressionless?
...Do you agree with him?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, very much so,
General Perceval.[A]
Even when you drink wine,
your expression stays the same.[A]
If you stop expressing emotion,
you'll forget how to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is not something
that can be forgotten.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not so sure when it comes
to you, General Perceval.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Getting fresh, are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha... It appears I need
not worry after all.[A]
[03B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein]
[OpenMidRight]Excuse me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Do you need something,
Commander Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck... You don't
recognize me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...How about that.
You do remember me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course! I recognized
you at once![A]
You didn't seem to notice
me over there...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]13 years...[A]
Young Master Klein is all
grown up, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You can stop calling
me Young Master.[A]
I'm 19 now.[A]
I serve as a commander
under the king himself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know.
Not bad at all.[A]
How are Lord Pent
and Lady Louise?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, just as laid-back as always.[A]
This calamity doesn't seem to
concern them at all.[A]
I envy them sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...there's plenty to
envy about you, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What do
you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We'll talk another time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck![A]
I wanted to talk more...[A]
[03B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Klein! Don't come out
front so much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is a good vantage point.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You bowmen should stay in back
and cover for us.[A]
There's no need for you to come
all the way up here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dieck, I told you, I'm not a
child anymore.[A]
I often find myself up front
in the squad I lead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry, but you're still
Young Master Klein to me.[A]
I couldn't face Lord Pent
if you got hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...If you care so much, why don't
you come back to the manse?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Dieck, once this war ends, come
back home with me.[A]
I'm certain Father and Mother
would love to see you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I appreciate the thought, Klein.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you really care about
your family,[A]
you shouldn't talk to a mercenary
like me. It won't look good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can only talk to me like this
now because this is war.[A]
Think about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Klein, you really shouldn't
be talking to me right now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I wanted to tell you a story.
I want you to listen.[A]
It was 15 years ago, at Aquileia's
greatest arena.[A]
A noble's child was attacked by a
lion in the opening display.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]A young arena combatant was the one
who saved the child.[A]
He was a skilled swordfighter who could
defeat men twice his size with ease.[A]
But fighting a lion isn't the same.
He didn't leave the fight unscathed.[A]
He left with wounds all over his body
and four deep scars on his face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The noble, impressed and moved by
the swordsman's selfless act,[A]
hired him into his family's service
and treated him well.[A]
For several years, the young man served
as the family's personal arena fighter.[A]
His name became known all across
the land.[A]
But one day, he decided to give up
that life and left.[A]
The child, who looked up to the
fighter as if he were a brother,[A]
felt betrayed, and was devastated.[A]
...But now I understand.[A]
You were doing what you felt was best
for me and my family...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...you were much too kind to me.
I was but a lowly fighter.[A]
Lord Pent and Lady Louise treated
me like family. Like a son.[A]
Gossip and accusations spread
about them.[A]
...That's why I left.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand that now.
But you should have stayed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You always wanted what was best
for us...[A]
But did you ever consider how much
we cared about you?[A]
I can't just forget about you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're right. I never
considered that. I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then you'll come with me
back to my family?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you win, Young Master Klein.[A]
I'll poke my head in at the manse
when I can.[A]
[03B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That was a rough battle, milord.[A]
Would you care to rest your
tired heart?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, you're...[A]
You're the bard that's always
with General Roy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, my name
is Elffin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Elffin, you look just like...
No... That's impossible.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Forgive me.
Never you mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I look just like
someone you know...[A]
Is that it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but...it can't be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I stand before you, telling you myself,
yet you still do not believe me.[A]
Do my own vassals lack trust
in me, Klein?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin!
It is you![A]
Oh...![A]
It's such a joy to see you
alive and well, Your Highness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to have grown
while I was gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Etruria has changed much in the year
of your absence, Your Highness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know. I am sorry I put
you through such trouble.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was stationed in the Western Isles
so I wasn't affected too much.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Amazing. You truly live...[A]
The Etrurian people will welcome
your return with jubilation![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[03B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight]Pr--
I mean, Lord Elffin![A]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Commander Klein,
can you spare a moment?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, what is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Lord.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Have I...done something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Someone is coming.[A]
We shall continue this
another day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[03B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadKlein][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...We have some
privacy here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pr--
Lord Elffin,[A]
you wished to speak with me?[A]
Is it about Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. It is about
what I said before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
When you said "Lord"?
I still don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you think it strange for an Etrurian
noble to call a simple bard "Lord"?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...!
Yes, you're right![A]
Forgive me.[A]
I shall call you Sir
Elffin instead...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just Elffin will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, that will not do![A]
Even if you are in disguise, I cannot
address my prince simply by name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...
...You haven't changed at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you remember how you used to come
to the palace with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
I spent much time there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I had no siblings, so I found you
so precious as a toddler.[A]
I was still young and foolish,
so I told your father,[A]
"Your son shall be my brother.
He is to live in the palace."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, the prince,
said that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know now that it
was ridiculous.[A]
Naturally, your father
struggled to respond.[A]
And then you spoke up.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I did...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. You said those same words.
"No, that will not do."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]"I will be your knight, so
that will not do."[A]
Those were your exact words.[A]
You also told me to find
someone else to be my brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...H-how impudent I was... I, uh...
Forgive me, Your Highness...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be absurd. I'm glad
that you haven't changed.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]...After I came back from the
brink of death,[A]
the world seemed so
different.[A]
It's relieving to see that some
things are still the same.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Prince Myrddin...[A]
[03B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thea.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Klein!
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine. I just wanted
to tell you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. When I hired you
and your squad...[A]
I was an Etrurian
commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Now that I'm no longer
an Etrurian commander,[A]
you are free to do as
you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you don't seem to be taking
advantage of that freedom.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I believe I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you trying to
say something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing.
Don't concern yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thea?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's about what you
said before...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said that I don't seem to be
taking advantage of my freedom...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not quite sure what you
meant, so I wanted to ask you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you're free to do what you want.
You have no obligation to stay here.[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]!![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]...Does that mean that you
don't want me anymore?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
Thea, you're a mercenary.[A]
Staying with this army isn't
making you much money.[A]
If you only fight alongside
us out of responsibility,[A]
there's no need for you to
stay here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know.[A]
This army doesn't pay
very well.[A]
But I'm here by my
own choice.[A]
Please don't worry
about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, all right, then.
I'm sorry to be a bother.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be.[A]
[03B9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKlein][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidLeft]
Thea, when the war ends, I'll help
you find an army that pays well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know you said that you're in
this army by choice,[A]
but I still feel responsible.[A]
You deserve further
compensation...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I can do that on my own.[A]
I appreciate the consideration,
but don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Or is my presence here
a hindrance to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no!
Not at all![A]
[OpenMidRight]Then why are you talking
to me like that?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What's the matter, Thea?
Why are you so upset...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]All you've talked about lately is
getting me out of this army...[A]
And away from you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
No, I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I choose to stay by your
side because I love you![A]
But you...you never
even realized it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Erm, well... I'm sorry.[A]
I...never noticed your
feelings towards me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]But, err...[A]
You know, Thea, it's really
your fault I haven't noticed![A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You keep calling me
"Commander" Klein.[A]
As if you want to keep your
distance![A]
That's why I thought you were
only here out of responsibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]B-but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't call me "Commander" anymore.
Just Klein, OK?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Commander Klein.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wrong.

we might talk a bit.[A]
Are you performing your

[OpenMidRight]Of course, Father Yoder.[A]
We get more followers every

Please take a look at

[OpenMidLeft]...Hm.[A]
There seem to be an overwhelmingly large
number of female names on this list.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well... You know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Err...[A]
Women must understand my sermons
better than gentlemen do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I see.
Very good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just remember, Saul, that your
duty is that of a missionary.[A]

can I...?[A]
[03BB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul][OpenMidLeft]Saul, how is your mission
coming along?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, yes. As I notified you
in my letter,[A]
Lord Roy is in possession
of the Fire Emblem now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Has there been anything
else worth noting?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, not particularly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
I am sorry to put you
through all this, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, please don't be.[A]
I did it all for our loving
Saint Elimine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.
That warms my heart to hear.[A]
...Oh, Saul. I have received
a complaint from Sir Merlinus.[A]
Apparently you stalk Princess
Guinivere wherever she goes...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Father Yoder.
That is my mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul, your mission is to keep
an eye on the Fire Emblem.[A]
And you already told me that it
is now in the hands of Lord Roy.[A]
Not Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, well, be that as it may,
consider this, Father Yoder.[A]
I can't follow Lord Roy wherever
he goes just because he has the Emblem.[A]
His appearance ill suits my tastes.
I cannot justify it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Saul?[A]
[03BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul][OpenMidLeft]Saul, perhaps it is time to
relieve you from your mission.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean,
Father Yoder?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I know Lord Roy
well enough to trust him.[A]
The Fire Emblem is safe
in his hands.[A]
What we feared will surely
not come to pass.[A]
Do you agree?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are probably right.[A]
...However, I wish to continue
my mission a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, I understand your
reasoning, Father Yoder.[A]
Lord Roy is certainly a
trustworthy person.[A]
Still...Lord Roy is young, and needs
people to guide him through this vile world.[A]
Who better than one such as I, with so
much experience in such ugliness?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er... All that said, I too am pure, so
disregard my declaration if you wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think I will.[A]
...Oh, Saul.[A]
I found this pamphlet
the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
This is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]"All wounds treated freely for members
of the church. Sign up today!"[A]
This...treating the gods like some
sort of commercial service.[A]
I do not approve of this at all...
What will others think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...Saul, I believe you may benefit
from hearing a sermon of mine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Father Yoder, I'm not worthy
to have the privilege of your...[A]

good day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, I was thinking, so I
didn't hear what you said.[A]
Would you please repeat it
for me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Erm...[A]
Sorry, I can't.[A]
Anyway, General Cecilia, seeing that
we are both servants of the gods,[A]
might you be interested in having
dinner with me some time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm sorry.[A]
I don't serve the gods
like you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you do, milady.
Everyone in the world serves the gods.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, absolutely. So should I make
arrangements for dinner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I'll think about it.[A]
[03BE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight]Ah, General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To have the privilege
of meeting you again...[A]
Your beauty is so overwhelming.
It is an honor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, more or less.[A]
But my only goal is to make
you feel at ease around me...[A][Clear]
Ah, yes![A]
We must decide on a date for
our dinner meeting.[A]
Have you thought about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dinner?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Th-this cannot be!
You've forgotten?[A]
We agreed that we all serve the
gods in our own way, remember?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, yes... I think I can
recall vaguely...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Vaguely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry.
I'm busy with the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Then I suppose it shall
have to be another day.[A]
But please do not forget
this time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'll try not to.[A]
[03BF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight]Ah!
General Cecilia![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Saul.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I trust that you have thought
about our dinner meeting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I will invite you to my
manor when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will look forward to that![A]
It is not every day that one is invited
to the manor of an Etrurian noble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you might want to bear in
mind that my father can be...[A]
a little difficult.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Difficult?
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, ordinarily my father is
a very kind and caring man.[A]
However, one time, when I
was still a child,[A]
I invited a male friend of
mine to the manor.[A]
When my father saw him, he drew
his sword and threatened his life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
I would call that more
than "difficult".[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My father lost his temper,
and we tried to calm him down.[A]
But he would have none of it.[A]
The tea spilled everywhere,
the table was sliced in two,[A]
and what was supposed to be a dinner
party was more like an arena battle.[A]
My friend somehow escaped with
his life.[A]
I will never forget that day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]But my father isn't that bad
compared to my grandfather...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, I just remembered![A]
I have some work at the church
that I must attend to.[A]
I'm terribly sorry,[A]
but I don't believe I will ever be
able to meet for dinner after all...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh? I was looking
forward to it.[A]
[03C0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidLeft]Oh, dear gods...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That I can meet such a
beautiful woman...[A]
I feel blessed this day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, as a matter of fact!
...Ah, before that...[A]
I am Saul. And you are,
my perfect flower?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am Igrene.
So...what do you need?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, such a beautiful name,
as I expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Igrene...[A]
If I were to describe the pleasure
of hearing such an elegant name--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, there is no need
for that.[A]
What is it that you need?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you know of the St. Elimine
Church, Igrene?[A]
It is very popular among
the nobility,[A]
because when one prays deeply,
all of one's dreams come true![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh... That's what
you want...[A]
I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in the gods...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, but you must.[A]
If you don't follow the teachings of
the church, you will be cursed![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...The gods you follow
would do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no, I was just kidding
around.[A]
How about we have dinner
together one evening?[A]
Then I can teach you all
about the gods' love...[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh, Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It is truly a miracle that
we could meet once more.[A]
Saint Elimine must have
guided you towards me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think so.
I'll be going now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, please wait![A]
It is a wonderful thing
to believe, Igrene![A]
[OpenMidRight]I know. I believed in
gods once.[A]
Different from yours,
though.[A]
I was quite devout.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
Why did you stop believing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Several years ago...
I stopped praying.[A]
It was after I lost a
loved one in battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Those who pray to the gods expect
something in return.[A]
But when they receive nothing,
they cease to believe they exist.[A]
I think it's less trouble to
never believe in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yes...
You may be right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Should a priest like you
really be saying that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, it's fine.
I am an open-minded person.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However, Saint Elimine
did say this:[A]
"When the gods don't help us,
it is because they believe in us."[A]
[OpenMidRight]They...believe in us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think they do.[A]
[03C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Brother Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Igrene!
What is the matter?[A]
Ah, you understand your feelings
at last, and decided to see me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's about what you said
before...[A]
You said when the gods don't help
us it's because they believe in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is what Saint Elimine said.[A]
The gods who created this world are
all-powerful.[A]
They can change people and the world.[A]
They can make humans docile so that
we don't fight as we do now.[A]
But what would that achieve?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Humans manipulated by the gods are
nothing more than mindless puppets.[A]
The gods believe that humans can change,
that we can learn from our mistakes.[A]
The gods know that we can overcome
our hardships to achieve peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
I don't believe in the gods, but I
respect what you say, Brother Saul.[A]
I must be off now...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, it is my pleasure
to be of assistance.[A]
Now, shall we discuss our
dinner meeting?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Igrene?
Where are you going?[A]
[03C3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidRight]Are you Brother Saul?[A]
I am Elen, a cleric of the
St. Elimine Church in Bern.[A]
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dear gods, I thank you
for your blessing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Um... Brother Saul?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly, being able to meet such a beautiful
lady is a blessing from the gods![A]
And you are a follower of the
St. Elimine Church, no less![A]
This meeting must have been part of
some divine plan.[A]
Please, let us meet this evening so that
we can discuss the love of the gods.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to.
What time can you meet?[A]
I am free all night...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Are you serious?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I am always serious
about the gods.[A]
Why would I refuse?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
...If you accept so easily,
there's no...satisfaction.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Satisfaction?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![A]
[ToggleSmile]Please, never you mind.
But Elen, are you sure?[A]
With a woman like you, I may lose
control, and...do things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not worried.
You are a priest.[A]
I'm sure you would
never do such a thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Er...
I'm sorry.[A]
Perhaps some
other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I was looking
forward to it...[A]
[03C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft]Why, hello, Elen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good day, Brother Saul.
It is good to see you well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You are so tense, so stressed!
You must relax your muscles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Absolutely. Those in service to the gods
must learn to unwind once in a while.[A]
You should enjoy the finer things in
life at times, as I do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I once knew a lady like you...[A]
Well, not "knew" so much as
"was slapped by", but...[A]
If you serve the gods, you must
experience all of their creation.[A]
You can experience things that will
open your eyes...[A]
Things that you will not believe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh my, yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Life is all about the
experiences we can have.[A]
Shall we discuss meeting
this evening again?[A]
I am free at any time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That would be marvelous.
I would love to hear you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Excellent. Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I shall invite the
others as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Excuse me?
The others?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes. If you will preach, then let
us help as many as we can.[A]
I'll ask Lord Roy, Merlinus, and any
others who are interested.[A]
I'm sure some of them will be
free tonight.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Dear me...
What to do...[A]
[03C5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSaul][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Brother Saul... Why didn't
you come that night?[A]
Everyone was so looking
forward to your sermon...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, er... My throat
was unwell that day.[A]
We can try again some
other time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, let's.[A][Clear]
Brother Saul, you are
so selfless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Selfless?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes. You appear to be an
impious womanizer.[A]
Hardly someone I would call
a priest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But I finally realized that there is
a reason for that.[A]
It is a character act.[A]
It is to show that the St. Elimine
Church accepts even the lowest of men.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...[A]
I, uh... Hmm. OK.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Acting as you do ruins your
reputation and image...[A]
Everyone thinks you're lazy and
only interested in women...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]But the truth is that you do it for
the church.[A]
I could not sacrifice myself as you do.
You have my respect, Brother Saul.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er... Thanks. I think.[A]
Well, anyway, just remember to
relax once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Brother Saul.[A]
[03C6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidRight]Madam Melady,
are you unhurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Elen, I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, if you're going up front,
please take these vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You seem to be more...
concerned than usual.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I don't think so.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you have something to say,
then I will listen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I can't force you...[A]
But as we both serve
Princess Guinivere,[A]
I would appreciate if
you voiced any concerns.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, well, I suppose I can
wait until you're ready.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
Madam Melady...[A]
[03C7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Madam Melady!
About before...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Before?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said that I
seemed concerned...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that.[A][ToggleSmile]
Are you ready to tell me
what's on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. Uh...[A]
It's just that...
I wanted to apologize.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Apologize?
For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]When the princess and I left to
meet with the Lycian lords,[A]
I didn't consult you at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I wanted to apologize for that...[A]
I know you have nothing but loyalty
for Princess Guinivere, yet I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You just followed Princess Guinivere's
orders, as is your duty.[A]
You have nothing to apologize for.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Elen, you always doubt your
actions too much.[A]
You won't be able to move forward
if your mind is stuck in the past.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[A]
[03C8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft]Elen, you look
a lot better now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I feel a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.[A]
Thank you again for listening
to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Any time at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...our roles are reversed...[A]
I am the cleric.[A]
It is I who am supposed to listen to
others to relieve them of their problems,[A]
and yet it is you who helped me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elen, I told you not to 
doubt your actions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm actually grateful you didn't tell
me when you left with the princess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Grateful...?
You are?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
You kept Princess Guinivere
safe even without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Madam Melady...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Together I'm sure we can be of
great help to Princess Guinivere.[A]
Just don't worry so much about
trivial matters anymore, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right.[A]
[03C9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElen][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elen![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Zeiss?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought that was you.
You are with this army as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I will always be at
Princess Guinivere's side...[A]
Did you join to help
Madam Melady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's part of it, of course,[A]
but the main reason is to see
how the princess helps Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you will be assisting
us as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, not exactly...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Actually, yeah, I guess
I will be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you. You will be of
great assistance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. Well, maybe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll see you then.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, see you later.[A]
[03CA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElen][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sir Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Elen, what's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I saw a man over there with a
terribly menacing look on his face...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?! Where?![A]
Oh, him?[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Elen, he's in
our army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh dear...
How very embarrassing...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did you scream or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'm afraid so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're still scared of men?[A]
I remember it was years before you
would speak to me normally like this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.
That's just how you are.[A]
But you don't need to
address me as "Sir".[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah...I...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]OK, OK, don't lose your
head about it...[A]
Well, I'll see you around.
Let me know if anything happens.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03CB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElen][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight]Elen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Z...
Sir Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]These flowers...![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They're the same as the ones you
grew back in Bern, aren't they?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Elen?
What's wrong?[A]
Wait, are these the
wrong flowers?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why are you always...
so kind to me...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh? Ah, er, well...[A]
We come from the same town,
and, uh... I don't know.[A]
I feel that I can't...
leave you alone, you know?[A][ToggleSmile]
I want to stay by your side
and[....] protect you...[A]
Do you not want me to?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm very glad...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I must stay by
Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[A]
I'm a knight of Bern, so I'll
protect the princess, too.[A][ToggleSmile]
I'll protect you both, so we
can someday return to Bern![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Zeiss...
Thank you.[A]
[03CC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft]Sister![A]
I got the medicine and cloth
you asked for from Merlinus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you. Could you leave
them there, please?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here?[A]
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you an assistant
to the transporter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I fight as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
A child like you...
in battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I may be a kid, but I'm
pretty handy with my magic![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I don't doubt your ability...[A]
It's just...children shouldn't
be on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm only about two years
younger than Lord Roy, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy...has no choice
but to be here.[A]
That is not the case
for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I have no choice, either.
I must fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks for the concern,
but I'm fine.[A]
Actually, there's someplace
I need to be right now.[A]
See you later, Sister![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[03CD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenMidLeft][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have a moment?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're the cleric
from before![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My name is Elen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And I am Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really do fight
on the battlefield...[A]
Are you all right?
You're not injured?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm fine.[A]
I may be small,
but I'm pretty fast.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh...[A]
I'm still uneasy about allowing such
a small child into battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I look so small?[A]
But if that's how you want to
play it,[A]
then isn't it just as dangerous to
send a frail lady like you into battle?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That...may be true, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yep![A]
So if you're ever in danger,
I'll come to your rescue.[A]
You can count on me![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, Lugh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please don't do
anything rash.[A]
[03CE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadElen][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadLugh][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sister Elen![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh?
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I-I thought I saw an
enemy near you...[A]
Huff, huff...[A][......]
[ToggleSmile]But I guess I was wrong.
Thank goodness.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You were looking out for me?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course!
I said I would protect you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You have such a kind heart...[A]
I am sure the gods look
favorably upon you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...That smile makes you look
like a goddess![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A goddess?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Actually, I was worried about you
because you always looked so pensive.[A]
Not that I can really blame you
given the war and all...[A]
But I feel so much better when
you smile like that![A]
[OpenMidRight]I feel better when I see
your smile too, Lugh.[A]
[03CF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadElen]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sister! Wait!
Wait, please![A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry, do you mean me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah. Sorry I yelled...[A]
But I need to ask
you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will help
you if I can.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]OK, well, unless I'm wrong, one of
these herbs is medicinal, right?[A]
Vulneraries are made from one of
these, aren't they?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, this one has medicinal
properties.[A]
I'm surprised you knew that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Poppa taught us at the
orphanage I used to live in.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He sounds like a good man.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, he sure was![A]
Well, I need to hurry
with this herb.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you?
Is someone hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, a traveler was hit
by a stray arrow.[A]
It's not a large wound, but
the bleeding won't stop.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My healing staff will be more
effective than the herb.[A]
Can you show me to this
traveler?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?!
You'll help him out?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's hurry!
This way![A]
[03D0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadElen]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sister Elen![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hello, Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks for your help
before.[A]
The traveler made
a full recovery.[A]
He wanted me to
thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I only did what
anyone would have.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No way! I've never met anyone willing to
use a pricy healing staff on a commoner.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Only those with the St. Elimine
Church treat commoners with staves.[A]
And even then, it's only when the
wound is lethal or something.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, at least that's how it is in the
Lycian countryside where I grew up.[A]
But that's why we learned how to use
herbs and things.[A]
...At least until Bern invaded.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa! S-sorry, I didn't mean to
make you feel down or anything...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not your fault...
I just can't believe...[A]
I can't believe my...home country
would start this war...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sister Elen, are you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. I...come from Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]!![A]
......[A][ClearFace][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Chad! Wait![A]
...Chad.[A]
[03D1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadElen]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Wait! Don't go![A]
Please...
Listen to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]My country started this war.[A]
So I understand...if you resent
a person of Bern like me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]But why?[A]
I see no hatred in your eyes.
Only sorrow.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Would you...tell me about it?[A]
I think it may release some of
the burden on your shoulders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Poppa...the father of our orphanage...
He was killed by Bern's soldiers...[A]
We had a little garden where
we grew food.[A]
The soldiers... They trampled it with
their horses because...[A]
because they said it was in the way.[A]
It was a tiny garden with nothing
but roots, and yet they still...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...Poppa was killed
protecting the garden?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah... It may have been just a bunch
of roots...but it was our food.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chad, you can cry...
If you feel sad, let it out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was the oldest of the orphans,
so I can't cry.[A]
The little kids and my best
friend Lugh...[A]
They went into shock seeing
Poppa killed before their eyes.[A]
It was my job to take care
of them.[A]
I don't want to lose any more
family... That's why I fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My hatred for Bern fuels my
strength...[A]
The drive to avenge Poppa and
protect all the orphans...[A]
That was my purpose in life.
It felt just![A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you hesitate now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I hated everyone from Bern.[A]
I thought they only cared
about themselves.[A]
...Until I met you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Chad... I'm on your side.[A]
Regardless of my home...I want
to help you.[A]
Do you hate me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I don't know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then I'll stay at your
side, Chad.[A]
I can't replace Poppa...[A]
But the least I can do is be
there for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Have it your way![A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Chad.[A]
[03D2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, well... You.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, hello.
You seem to be doing well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh... You've become an old man
since the last time I saw you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, yes, it's so embarrassing.
But you're as youthful as ever I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Is that sarcasm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all.[A]
...It truly has been a long time.
How many years ago was it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Forty...no, fifty years?
A long time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... Indeed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think I finally understand
how you felt back then.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, and I, you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But that was a long time ago...
A time that will never return.[A]
Our paths split that day.
They'll never cross again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[03D3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadYoder][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yoder... Yoder!
Are you listening?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Niime...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...They killed your sister. She cried
your name out as she died.[A]
And still...you refuse to
do a thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're telling me to forgive them?
Hah, what will that accomplish?[A]
If we let them live, they're sure
to repeat their actions.[A]
More innocent people will die by
their hands.[A]
Is that what you want?
Answer me, Yoder![A]
[OpenMidRight]Niime, I...[A][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder]
[OpenMidLeft]Yoder?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Niime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What were you doing?
I almost thought you'd up and died.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I was reminiscing about
the past.[A]
If I just close my eyes, I can see
it as if it were happening now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh...
Finally going senile, are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Foul words still pour from your
mouth as they always did...[A]
[03D4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadYoder][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]The end of this war...
draws near.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What will you do
after it ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who knows? I already told you our
paths will never cross again.[A]
We'll go our separate ways,
as we did before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Niime, you and I have changed.[A]
Our paths may just cross
again one day.[A]
I will pray for it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Well, no one can know the future.[A]
A path that splits at one point...
may join again further down the road...[A]
Who can say...?[A]
[03D5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft]Hm...
So this is a wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...Father Yoder of
the St. Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, it's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Madam Melady.[A]
She is so passive...[A]
I imagined wyverns to be more
ferocious creatures.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tryffin will spread her wings and
bare her fangs at my command.[A]
However, that is only because of
her training by the Bern Army.[A]
...Perhaps she wishes not to
fight at all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps not...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tryffin and I have trained together
ever since we were both young.[A]
We trained hard to be proud warriors
in service to our country.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I...[A]
I don't regret leaving Bern
with Princess Guinivere.[A]
But Bern is still my home...[A]
It is painful to fight against
my former allies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I can only imagine.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I must get used to it.[A]
For Princess Guinivere...
and for my country.[A]
[03D6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Is something wrong,
Madam Melady?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... It's just that my
home is in this area.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah... Do you have
family here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My grandfather and my parents.[A]
My father and his father used to tell
stories of battles they fought in.[A]
How elated they were when my brother
and I were knighted as well...[A]
I wonder what they're doing now...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Madam Melady...[A]
Your path has been a
difficult one indeed.[A]
Forgive me. I have
little to offer you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be...[A]
Simply your ear is more helpful
than you may realize...[A]
I needed someone like you to
listen to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I will be more than happy to listen
to anything you have to say.[A]
Don't forget, Madam Melady...
You are not alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,
Father Yoder...[A]
[03D7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoder][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight]Father Yoder, I must thank you
for helping me.[A]
I no longer feel alienated in
this army...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course...
It is my pleasure.[A]
Tryffin, your master is
a very kind-hearted person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've put her through a
lot of difficulty.[A]
I'm sure she never wanted to
turn her back on Bern...[A]
I dragged her along with me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I hear that Bern's training instills
absolute loyalty in its troops.[A]
Both in the knights, and in
the mounts.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, definitely.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If that is so, why do you think
Tryffin follows you against Bern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There are other wyvern riders of
Bern in the enemy ranks we fight.[A]
There are even high-ranking
commanders and generals.[A]
If this wyvern only followed the army's
commands, she would not have stayed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you understand
what that means?[A]
This wyvern has a will of
her own.[A]
She chose to be with you.[A]
Just as you chose to be with
Princess Guinivere.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...She has a will of her own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are blessed,
Madam Melady.[A]
You have a close friend
at your side.[A]
I dare say you don't
even need me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I think
you're right...[A]
Thank you...[A]
[03D8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chad!
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Something smells good...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Here you go.
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, baked tarts![A]
Where'd you get these?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The man who delivers our meals
gave me some extra ones.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...They look so good...
Can I really have them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right! Thanks![A][Clear][ToggleSmile]
...They taste as
good as they look.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, sorry.[A]
It's just that you always look
so happy when you're eating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah. You look so peaceful.
I'm almost envious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-what the...?
Don't make fun of me.[A]
I-I'll be going now.
Thanks for the food![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, I wasn't making fun of you.
It's nothing to be embarrassed of.[A]
[03D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh!
Here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
Oh, a new pair of shoes?
Where did you get these?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't steal them, all right?[A]
The other day I came across an
old lady who lost her key,[A]
so I helped her out and she
gave me these shoes as thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then why don't you wear them?
She gave them to you, not me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
My shoes aren't as beat up as
yours, and besides,[A]
they're a little small
for me anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But we're the same size.[A]
If they're small for you, they
must be small for me, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]J-just take them![A]
I'm older, so my feet are a
little bigger than yours![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
That's not how it works![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course it is!
End of story.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Just take the shoes,
all right?[A]
See you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Chad!
...Thanks.[A]
[03DA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Chad![A]
What's wrong?
Is something on your mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh...[A]
I was just thinking that we've been
in this army for a while now.[A]
I wonder how the children are
doing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I wonder.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I hope they're being good
for the Elimine priests...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder if they're waiting
for us to return...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sure they are.
We're family.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've got to say...
I'm glad you came.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?[A]
Do you finally think
I'm strong enough?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I already knew that
you were strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How can I say this...?[A]
Your twin brother, Raigh.[A]
I always felt I was the odd one
out when we three were together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be ridiculous![A]
You're family to me, just
as much as Raigh is![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I know!
I know better now.[A]
I was just creating a
wall around myself.[A]
But now I know that
you're family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...OK, I'll let it slide.[A]
You're my older brother, even if
you are...a little childish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?!
Get back here, Lugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha![A]
[03DB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Raigh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Chad.[A]
I don't recall
summoning you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I wouldn't be here
if I didn't need to be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Roy...[A]
I mean Lord Roy wants
to see us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You think I care?![A]
[OpenMidRight]P-pipe down!
Don't be so loud![A]
That Merlinus guy'll
be after us again![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're afraid of that
old geezer, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, sure.[A]
He and Lord Roy
are nobles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha. Little Chad bows
down to nobles now, does he?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Laugh if you like.
But let me say this.[A]
Nobility don't like to
be opposed.[A]
Lord Roy doesn't seem like
he would anger too easily,[A]
but I don't know about
the others.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I don't want to see the
people I care about get hurt.[A]
I know you're proud of that
mouth of yours,[A]
but unless you want to be
killed, keep it shut.[A]
...I'm going.
You better come, too.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03DC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You still steal, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've got no choice.
I can't use magic like you.[A]
My only use in this army is picking
locks and gathering intel...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I think it's
invaluable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The other day when we went
to see that Roy fellow...[A]
He said he appreciated our work
because we're close to his age.[A]
But you humbled yourself the
whole time, belittling your work.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah? And?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You do something no one
else can.[A]
Have some pride in it.[A]
You look stupid when you
put yourself down.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Uh, are you trying
to cheer me up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-don't be ridiculous![A]
Why would I ever want to
cheer you up?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I thought so.[A]
Good, you had me
worried for a second.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Fine!
I'm leaving![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey! What's your problem?[A]
[03DD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidRight]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't ignore me.
I need to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you planning to do
when the war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You first.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll go see the children.[A]
Then I'll try and get enough
money to rebuild the orphanage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then I'll go with you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can help out until the
kids have a home at least.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I thought you would.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I knew you had a
heart deep down inside.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wh--?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh always said you were a
kind boy.[A]
I used to think he only defended
you because you're brothers,[A]
but I guess not.[A]
Your brother knows the real you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're just as naive
as Lugh![A]
Say what you will!
I'm leaving![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hah, there's no need
to be embarrassed...[A]
Hey! Wait! You're
actually leaving?![A]
[03DE]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got talent.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]OK, so who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You don't know me?
I'm Cath, Master Thief![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Who?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Stupid, ignorant...
I'm a better thief than you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You're below me. You should
be begging me for tips.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think so.[A]
I learned how to steal all on my own,
and I'm gonna keep it that way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, you won't get any further
like that.[A]
I guess I can take you under my wing.
Show you the ropes. Since you insist.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait,
when did I--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now you're my first apprentice.
You must do my bidding.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why should I?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know one good reason.
Isn't this your bag?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-hey!
When did you...?![A]
Give it back![A]
[03DF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Give me back my bag!
Now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Easy there, fella.
Here ya go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]What are those sketches?
Who is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Poppa... Not my real
father, but close enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I wasn't the brightest student,
but Poppa always praised my drawings.[A]
He said I had nimble fingers and
that I could be an artist someday...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
I see...[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]......
......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Argh![A]
Now things are awkward.
I like it positive.[A]
You should too, Firsty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean
by "Firsty"? [A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's you.[A]
You're my first
apprentice, remember?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I never agreed to that![A]
[03E0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Firsty.
How ya been?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been watching you.
You seem to be improving.[A]
You're still nowhere near
my level, though. Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, whatever.
I'm not your apprentice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A][ToggleSmile]
If not my apprentice, then
how about my partner?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Partner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.
We could be partners.[A]
The fabled pair of thieves
out to save the poor![A][Clear]
Sounds pretty cool, huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Partners...[A][Clear]
...Sounds stupid.
No thanks.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Wait a minute![A]
I'm Cath, Master Thief!
You should be honored![A]
Come back here![A]
[03E1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! Are you Hugh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh? So what if
I am, kid?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Is it true that you're
a moneylender?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe. Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I want to borrow 3,000 gold.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you're out of luck, kid.[A]
I only lend money to grown-ups.
Especially to lovely ladies.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh.[A]
All right, I'll ask
someone else then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, hey, hey,
slow down there.[A]
Have a little more
persistence, kid.[A]
You can't give up
so easily.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you only lend money
to adults, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if you insist, I can
make an exception for you.[A]
But your interest will be
twice the normal rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought you'd say
something like that.[A]
...But fine.
Let me borrow the money.[A]
I'll give it back when
we get paid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three.
Here you go, 3,000 gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.
See you later.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Remember, it's 4,000 after
interest![A]
[ToggleSmile]...How could I turn him down
after he looked at me like that?[A]
This is why I hate kids...[A]
[03E2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! Here's the
money I owe you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]One, two, three, four.
Yup, that's 4,000.[A]
I haven't seen you around lately
so I thought you ran off with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I keep my promises.
What kind of person doesn't?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'd be surprised.[A]
You're an honest kid. You sure
you chose the right career?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop calling me "kid".
My name is Chad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, Chad.[A]
So tell me, why'd you
become a thief?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Stealing's the only way
I could live. I'm an orphan.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you live alone?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, I lived in a small orphanage
in Lycia near the border to Bern.[A]
I grew up with other orphans.[A]
We did pretty well. Poppa and
the other kids and me...[A]
...If this war hadn't broken
out, I'd still be there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Poppa was a good man,[A]
but he could only keep the orphanage
running through charity.[A]
After the war started we began
to run low on food and clothes.[A]
I was the oldest of the orphans,
but I couldn't find any work.[A]
So the only way to get food was
to steal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then I'm guessing you sent that
3,000 gold to the orphanage...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
...The orphanage isn't
there anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Poppa was killed by Bern's troops
and the place was burned down...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]W-what about the children?
Were they spared?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks to Poppa, yeah.
None of us were hurt.[A]
The children are with the
St. Elimine Church now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I used the money to buy a
strong sword.[A]
I'm going to use it to end
this war quickly.[A]
Then I can go back to the
children![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So the kids are family to you.
You want to protect them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right.
I've got nothing else.[A]
You got a problem
with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not at all...[A]
I'm sorry I was so rude
with you before.[A]
You've already grown up, Chad.[A]
You're certainly more of an
adult than I am.[A]
[03E3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadChad][OpenMidLeft]Hey! Chad!
Have you been doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I guess.
But not as well as you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Man, are you always
such a downer?[A]
Can't you be more like,[A][ToggleSmile]
"Hey, Hugh! What's up?"
And smile for a change.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I think I'd vomit if
I tried to do that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aw, come on![A]
Your story really made me
think. I want to help you![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Are you really a mage, old man?[A]
You seem more like some kind of
jester or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]O-old man!?[A]
Does this handsome face look
like it belongs to an "old man"?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. Well, compared
to mine, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh!
Daggers through my heart![A]
...I take personal offense
to "old man".[A]
Seriously, you can call me
anything.[A]
Smelly, messy, stupid, anything.
Just don't call me "old man"![A]
I feel like my soul has died
a little after hearing that![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha![A]
Ha ha...huff... My...my stomach...!
Ha ha ha...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]!![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Oh man, that reaction was
priceless.[A]
I really pressed your buttons
with that, didn't I?[A]
Fine, I'll call you Hugh.
You're OK with that, aren't you?[A]
Since you claim you're not
an old man.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you are capable of
laughing after all![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You've always got that
glare in your eyes.[A]
Your brow is always
furrowed like you're mad.[A]
And you're rude, you
have an attitude,[A]
and you never smile.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry, what are you
talking about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've seen so many kids lose the
ability to laugh thanks to this war.[A]
Grown-ups have a lot of issues,
but come on, kids have to laugh.[A]
Even if the idiots who start these
wars don't think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]If there are still kids who can laugh,
then maybe there is hope after all.[A]
I know you've had it rough, but you
have to laugh once in a while, OK?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]H-hey!
Don't mess up my hair![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha, sorry!
I'll see you later.[A]
Just don't screw up![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe adults aren't all
as awful as I thought...[A]
[03E4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight]Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please let me stay with you so
I can master the sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If that's what you want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you!
...But...[A][ToggleSmile]
It doesn't feel right to fight
alongside you.[A]
I'm still a novice, but you're the
strongest fighter in our army![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]None of them know how strong
you are![A]
Once they see the true strength
of the Sword Saint, they'll...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's inappropriate.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I respect you so much,
so I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idolizing another is
pointless.[A]
One must not seek strength
for admiration.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, Uncle.[A]
[03E5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight]Uncle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Fir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please, teach me the
way of the sword![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]I want to know how you
gained your power.[A]
I want to master the
sword like you did.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The way of the sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not something that
can be taught, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A sword is simply a sword.
It is a weapon used to kill people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That...[A]
That's not true![A]
[OpenMidLeft]There's no strength to be found in
this hunk of metal.[A]
I have lived by the sword since my birth,
but my blade never gained any power.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]True strength does not
come from a weapon.[A]
It is not something that
can be seen or touched.[A]
But it exists within all
of us.[A]
It exists within you,
too, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]M-me...?[A]
[03E6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadFir]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please tell me,
Uncle![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What is true strength...?
What is the right way...?[A]
What must I do...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Fir.[A]
You have always followed in
your mother's footsteps.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Now that you've lost sight of your
mother, you come to me for advice.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Fir.[A]
You are not your mother.
You are not me.[A]
You cannot follow us to
the path you seek.[A]
It lies in front of you.[A]
It is you who must cut
that path for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's...in front of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It isn't something that can
be taught.[A]
It is something you must
discover on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I understand.
Thank you, Uncle![A]
[03E7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...I'm so sorry about Karla.[A]
I just wish it could have
been me instead of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Honestly, my sister's health
was never particularly good.[A]
I'm just glad she lived as
long as she did.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The one thing I am concerned
about is Fir.[A]
She lost her mother at such
a young age...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes... Maybe...[A]
Maybe the reason she left to train was
to get her mind off her mother's death.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She left to train?[A]
Is Fir traveling
across Elibe?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That she is.[A]
She said she wanted to become a
great swordmaster like her mother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that so...[A]
[03E8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Bartre...
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Karel.[A]
...I was just thinking
about Karla.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, always.[A]
I first met her in my travels around
the world, when I was training.[A]
I remember it like it was yesterday...
We first met at that arena.[A]
Her sword...
I couldn't even see it.[A]
...I suffered defeat for
the first time in my life.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...In our family, the sword was
everything.[A]
We were raised by the sword,
and it was all we knew.[A]
The sword was so central to our lives...
that it blinded us to our own humanity.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Each time I lost, I challenged
her to a rematch.[A]
And then, the third time we fought,
I somehow evaded her first strike.[A]
I was knocked unconscious by her
second strike, though...[A]
But when I woke up...
there she was.[A]
It was the first time I'd seen
her smile.[A]
After that, we traveled together,
training ourselves to be ever stronger.[A][Clear]
I was never able to defeat her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't see my sister
smile very often...[A]
She must have been
very fond of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think so...?[A]
[03E9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...After she fell sick, Karla told me
about her family for the first time.[A]
She talked about her heritage, about
you, and...about herself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure my sister was happy to be
with you in her time in this world.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That was around the time that
I first met you as well...[A]
You resembled Karla when I
first met her.[A]
You were inhumanly strong...
Dangerous and quiet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...That sounds like me.[A]
I remember leaving the two
of you without a word.[A][ToggleSmile]
You must have thought me a
terrible brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
As she lay dying, Karla told me
about her childhood with you...[A]
She would tell me so many stories,
all with a smile on her face.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Is that so...[A]
[03EA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You noticed me at this distance?
Very impressive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Karel the Sword Saint.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know of me?
I am honored.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Everyone who wields the
sword knows your name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, well, I traveled
a lot in my youth.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why are you in this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My family is here, so
I joined as well.[A]
I only hope I'm not
too rusty.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rusty?
Surely you jest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, it is no jest.[A]
I'm sure I can't hold a
candle to you younger ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft]...Interesting fellow.[A]
[03EB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft]Please wait a moment.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am looking for a
sparring partner.[A]
Would you care to
practice with me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why not?[A]
Am I unworthy of
sparring with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your sword is not soaked red...
I pursue a different path.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Perhaps you think so now, but we
both follow the way of the sword...[A]
All paths of the sword lead to
the same destination.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03EC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadRutger][OpenMidLeft]...Do you need something,
Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to ask you something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I sense no hatred from your sword...[A]
You seem to blend with the air
when you attack.[A]
Even the heaviest, strongest
blades can't be one with the air...[A]
Your sword bests them all.
I want to be stronger.[A]
If all paths of the sword lead
to one place,[A]
will I someday be able to blend
with the air as you do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You're from Sacae,
aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was born in Sacae as well.[A]
I grew up under the eye of our Father
the Sky and our Mother the Earth.[A]
They are the only ones within
my blade.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not pure Sacaen...[A]
I can't sense them
like you do...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Could you hear them when
you were young?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]!![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]You were able to hear the Sky
and the Earth once.[A]
Your hate deafens your ears.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Do you think I will be able to
hear them when this war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course you will.[A]
The breeze that blows
through the plains...[A]
It never forgets those
it loves.[A]
[03ED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the Sword Saint...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...That's not what I prefer
to be called.[A]
Karel will do.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Karel, I am a
wyvern rider of Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...You're not going to say
anything?[A]
My father said you fought
against Bern in the past.[A]
He saw you in a rain of blood,[A]
slicing through all who
crossed your path...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I am through caring about the
goings-on of the world.[A]
Bern, Etruria, Lycia...
They are meaningless to me now.[A]
I am only here now for my family.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I envy you.
I wish I could be so unconcerned...[A]
But I can't...[A]
Not even now that Bern has fallen...[A]
[03EE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Before making it here...
I fought my older brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We weren't related by blood,
but we truly were brothers...[A]
His name was Galle.[A]
He was a wyvern rider that easily
rivaled the Wyvern Generals in skill.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I always looked up to him.
My sister was also very fond of him...[A]
...I never thought he would end up
as our enemy.[A]
I never conceived that we would
have to fight Galle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry...[A]
Have I bored you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, not at all.[A]
A life story is
never boring.[A]
[03EF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why...?[A]
Why did you tell
me that story?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I thought you might have some
guidance for me...[A]
I thought you might help rid
me of my unease...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm afraid I have no
advice for you.[A]
But...I will say this.[A]
You must carve your
own path.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Zeiss...[A]
I think you already
know your answer.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.[A]
Perhaps...I just wanted someone to tell
me that my path is the correct one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I understand now.[A]
I chose to turn against my country...
and I don't regret that decision.[A]
[03F0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I've never heard of
this place before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]This is a land that people have
long forgotten.[A]
The years go by, but time
doesn't seem to pass...[A]
That is the best way to
describe this place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you always lived here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No. I used to travel the world.
I lived by the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Then...have you ever
been to Ilia?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Yes. Once.[A]
[03F1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight]The Sword Saint...[A]
Does that name ring
any bells?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]My mother used to tell me
stories about him.[A]
When I was very young,[A]
a group of bandits attacked
our village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]If the Sword Saint hadn't saved
us, I wouldn't be here today.[A]
Wherever he is, I hope he knows
how much I appreciate him...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No. There's nothing
to be grateful for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What? Why do
you say that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[03F2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKarel][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Sir Karel...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I suppose I should tell you the
truth.[A]
To cover my shame would be to go
astray from the way of the sword.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shame?
You saved my village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No. I never cared about
saving the village.[A]
I just wanted to kill.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I was a demon back then...
possessed by the sword.[A]
I wandered aimlessly, looking
to sate my bloodlust.[A]
I didn't care who I cut.
Who I killed.[A]
...I'd have even killed you,
I'm sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]You have no reason to thank me.
They call me the Sword Saint...[A]
But it is a false name.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]When I look at you, I can't even
begin to believe what you're saying.[A]
You are the Sword Saint I've always
pictured in my mind.[A]
What...happened...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Some things we only realize
after suffering a great loss.[A]
By the time my foolishness had
left me...it was already too late.[A]
[03F3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiirrr!
Where are you?[A]
Fiiirrr![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiirrr![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir]F-Father...
You are much too loud.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, there you are, Fir!
It's good to see you safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Father...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I hadn't seen you for
a while.[A]
I was worried you'd
disappeared forever.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous,
Father...[A]
We were just sparring
not long ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We don't have many chances to talk
one-on-one, daughter and father.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now is your chance, Fir.[A]
Tell your father anything
that's on your mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]F-Father...[A]
I'm sorry, but I have
orders from Lord Roy.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you?
Then I shall accompany you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm grateful, but I need to
do things on my own.[A]
Otherwise, I won't improve
the way I want to.[A]
I'll see you again, Father.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hrmm...
Be careful, my daughter.[A]
[03F4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiirrr![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fiiirrr![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Where are you,
my daughter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir]F-Father...[A]
There's no need to
shout so loudly...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been hearing some
troubling rumors, Fir.[A]
I hear that another man in the
army is secretly seeing you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it true, my daughter?
If so, fear not![A]
I will crush anyone who
would hurt you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no, it's nothing like that![A]
[OpenMidLeft]He's helping me with my training.
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oho, so you merely wanted a
training partner.[A]
Have no worries, my daughter.
Your father is here to train you![A]
Now come, punch me as hard
as you can![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
I appreciate it, but I need
someone who can use a sword...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry, Father...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hrmm...[A]
Take care of yourself,
my daughter.[A]
[03F5]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fiiirrr![A][Clear]
[OpenMidRight]Fiii--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFir]I'm right here![A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Fir.
You are unharmed...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father!
Enough is enough![A]
I'm quite fine on my own!
I don't need you to protect me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...I'm sorry.
I was wrong...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Forgive me, my daughter...[A]
I just wanted to make
up for lost time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lost...time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
When you were still young, your
mother and I were always training.[A]
I regret now that I didn't give
you the attention you needed.[A]
You never knew the warmth and
protection a parent can give...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You've grown into such a strong
and confident young woman.[A]
You did that all on your own.[A]
I just wanted to help you in
any way I could...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Father... You were always kind
and loving.[A]
Whenever I was down, you held me in
your strong arms and comforted me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Father...
I've always loved you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fir...
Oh, my daughter![A]
[OpenMidLeft]F-Father![A]
This isn't the place to
break down and cry![A]
[03F6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Noah, I have something
to ask of you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK. Shoot.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I want to spar
with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh... For your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. I must experience all forms
of swordplay to master the art.[A]
You taught me some things at
that arena, and...[A]
I would appreciate some
additional training.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if that's what you want,
then sure, no problem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Thank you![A]
Let's start now,
then...[A][Clear][CloseSpeechFast][.....]
Wha--!?[A][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Are you OK?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-yes!
I'm sorry![A]
I'm up, I'm up...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not like you to
trip like that.[A]
Are you hurt?
Let me see your knee...[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-no... I-I'm fine!
We must continue sparring![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you really OK?
You don't seem quite...well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-we fight![A]
[03F7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Fir.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you OK?[A]
You should tell me if
you're not feeling well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I'm fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You look like
you have a fever...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-it's nothing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...your face is
bright red.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I said it's nothing![A]
I'm just in a little
slump is all![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir? Is something on
your mind?[A]
If you need someone to
talk to, I'd be happy to...[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah!
I don't mean to be rude, but...[A]
D-don't talk to me anymore![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Fir.[A]
[03F8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Wait, Fir!
Don't go.[A]
I need to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I-I...[A]
I swore to myself that I would
live by the sword.[A]
But...[A]
I find my mind wandering.
It's always focused on you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir...[A]
[OpenMidRight]G-goodbye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFir]Wha--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you remember the
first time we met?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since then, I've wanted to
tell you something.[A]
But I could never muster up the
courage to say it.[A]
Even after we said our
good-byes,[A]
I always regretted not telling
you how I felt.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe fate brought us back
together when we met again on the Isles.[A]
I've been keeping it in all this
time, but I can't any longer.[A]
I have to tell you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]S-Sir Noah...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fir, I...[A][Clear][.....]
I love you.[A]
[03F9]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, excuse me,
are you Rutger?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering if you would spar
with me, if we get the chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]I've been training my skills and
I've won at many arenas around Elibe.[A]
So you don't have to go easy on me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I won't spar with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?
Is it because I'm a woman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I swing my sword to kill.[A]
I have no interest in using
the blade for play.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Play?![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]W-wait...![A][Clear]
...He thinks of sparring as
"play"?[A]
I was hoping to learn from him.[A]
His blade is sharp and he has
no hesitation in his eyes...[A]
[03FA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger!
We fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Get out of my way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No. I will not move until you
understand that I am serious.[A]
Draw your sword![A]
I train myself seriously.[A]
I will not tolerate you calling
my training mere "play". [A]
I want to become stronger,
so I want to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I told you that I use
my sword to kill.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
But my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I draw my blade here,
you will die.[A]
Is that your wish?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]You don't intend to
kill me, do you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, no...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's why your
training is play.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...I just...[A]
...Maybe I was being rude.[A]
I should apologize the next
time I see him.[A]
[03FB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFir][OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight]Rutger.[A]
Wait, please don't glare
at me like that...[A]
I'm not here to fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]But your skills are impressive.
I want to reach your level.[A]
All I want is to be as strong
as you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Just be yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My blade is soaked in blood.[A]
Our paths differ too greatly
for you to learn from me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]A great man once told me,[A]
"All paths of the sword lead
to the same destination."[A]
I don't know if that's true,[A]
but I can tell you've gone
down one of those paths.[A]
I still have much to learn,
so I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Think what you will.[A]
[03FC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ack![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Good as ever,
I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Rutger...
Stop trying to kill me from behind![A]
I'd have a heart attack if I had to
deal with you on a daily basis.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha...[A]
I'll get my sword through
your back one day.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]OK, I get it, we hated each other
when we were on different sides.[A]
But why do you want to slice me in half
now that we're in the same army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The others bore me.[A]
I need someone of your
strength to duel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So you're gonna kill me all
because you're bored.[A]
Fantastic.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]As if you've ever let
my sword cut you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can't be on guard all the time!
I don't wanna die![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah. I'll get you
next time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]What a guy...[A]
[03FD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
Hey! I told you to
cut that out![A]
You don't know
when to quit...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hm...?
You seem to be in a bad mood.[A]
Did something happen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Lemme guess...[A]
You spotted a personal
enemy in Bern's ranks?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Bullseye.[A]
Why are you taking
it out on me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I saw the man who led the
attack on my hometown of Bulgar.[A]
But when I reached him...
he was already dead.[A]
You defeated him, Dieck.[A]
Those sword marks...
It had to be you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Sorry.[A]
Had I known, I would have
left him to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...This is a battlefield.
Enemies don't belong to anybody.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Rutger... Seriously, take
it easy once in a while.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You can't live life on
edge all the time...[A]
[03FE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRutger][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Rutger, you all right?
You don't look well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm having trouble sleeping.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the man who led
the Bulgar attack?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
Well...maybe.[A]
Even after seeing him dead, the
nightmares still persist.[A]
In that attack...they
spared me...[A]
The reason was because I...
I didn't look Sacaen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tough to kill someone with
the same face.[A]
But you do have Sacaen blood
in you, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. My father's mother and my
mother's father were Sacaen.[A]
Bulgar is near Bern's border, so many
people of mixed blood lived there.[A]
Usually the Sacaen blood shows itself
more prominently.[A]
But...[A]
But I was different. I appear to be
of Bern, so I was left alive...[A]
The people of Bulgar...were kind to
me, even though I looked different...[A]
But they...they were all killed,
and so brutally![A]
I must raze the entirety of the
Kingdom of Bern to the ground...![A]
One man isn't enough to satisfy
my revenge...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I always wondered if you had some
story, but now it all makes sense...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Hope you don't mind me tagging along.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Keep your sympathy![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Come on. You know how strong I am.[A]
If you really want to take on Bern,
what better ally is there than me?[A]
What do you say?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Do as you will.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And I will.
Let's go, partner![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Dieck...
I'm sorry.[A]
[03FF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ward. Let me talk
to you for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Whuh?
Sure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pay more attention to what's
going on around you.[A]
The way you fight, you're just
asking to be killed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Aw, c'mon, Big Man, I haven't
died yet.[A]
I can crush anything with
these massive arms...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've heard those same words from
plenty of young hotshots before.[A]
They're all dead now.[A]
You just worry me is all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, all right...[A]
You're the boss,
Big Man.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
I'm glad you can take
some criticism.[A]
[0400]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Big Man!
Did you see me?![A]
I took down three guys
with one swing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you even remember
what I told you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?
Uhh...[A][Clear]
Charge?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No![A]
I told you to pay more attention
to your surroundings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fighting like that just
doesn't sit well with me.[A]
I'm getting even stronger,
too.[A]
I'll crush anyone who
dares stand up to me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward![A]
[ToggleSmile]...That kid can't
sit still, can he?[A]
[0401]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Big Man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sorry. You win.[A]
I almost got myself killed earlier,
then I remembered what you told me.[A]
Maybe I was getting carried away...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I think so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since then, I've been
following your advice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that.
You're still alive.[A]
If you pay more attention, you
won't die like a fool.[A]
With your strength, you can impress
people no matter how you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you OK?
You're, like...praising me.[A]
It feels...weird.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shut up.
Let's go.[A]
[0402]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey Big Man, what do you
think of our employer?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That Roy kid?[A]
You first.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I like him.[A]
He's an impressive
commander for his age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, he is.[A]
But...he's young.
Too young.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand why you like him.[A]
He's a nice kid, and he's got
brains and guts.[A]
But...these battles are all
small-time.[A]
When we get to a real battle, and
he's in a life or death situation...[A]
That's when we'll see what kind of
leader he really is...[A] 
[0403]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Years ago...when I first
became a mercenary...[A]
All I cared about was
making a name for myself...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really...?
I wouldn't have expected that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our squad was sent right behind
enemy lines.[A]
Our mission was to go deep into
Bern and finish the enemy leader.[A]
We waited in a cave for days...
and then the time came.[A]
When we moved out...arrows
rained down on us...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our employer...[A]
He had put us there so he could
buy time for himself and escape.[A]
Our squad was decimated.
They killed everyone.[A]
Except for me, of course.
They tortured me for information.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]We mercenaries are expendable
in a client's eyes.[A]
That's the norm.
You need to understand that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...that Roy kid...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...he's different.
I just wish I'd met him sooner...[A]
[0404]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight]So...
We're still alive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That we are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Funny, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We're mercenaries.[A]
We shouldn't care who wins. We fight
for money and self-preservation.[A]
We're better off walking away from
a tough fight than staying.[A]
But...it's different now.[A]
We've been through so many tough
battles, and still, here I am.[A]
Roy...makes me feel like I fight
for a purpose.[A]
Like I could die for him and have
no regrets.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You took the words right
out of my mouth.[A]
[0405]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Hey, Captain![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, please.
Don't call me "Captain."[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?[A]
Back in Ilia, we always
call our leader captain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't like it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, um...[A]
OK, then I'll call you
Big Man, like Lot and Ward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, can't use
that, either?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just call me Dieck,
like you always have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No![A]
I always feel left out when they call
you Big Man and I just call you Dieck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait!
Dieck![A]
[0406]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, I see you fighting on
your own a lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yeah. I'm on a pegasus,
as you can plainly see.[A]
I move at a different pace, so
it's easier to fight by myself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want you to slow down to
our pace from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
But I do fine on my own![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It worries us when you go
charging in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But if I get stronger...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Can you stand up to a
whole army on your own?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Um, no.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then match your pace with the
others and work as a team.[A]
That'll maximize our chance
of victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That'll help us win, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wars aren't fought alone,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0407]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDieck][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Dieck![A]
See how I've been adjusting my
pace to the others lately?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...[A]
But don't rely on
them too much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
That's not what you
said earlier![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What I said then
applies to soldiers.[A]
What I'm saying now
applies to sellswords.[A]
[OpenMidRight]To sellswords...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A sellsword has to fend for
him or herself.[A]
No one's gonna watch
your back.[A]
Always question others.
You should even question me.[A]
Question whether my orders
serve the group,[A]
or if they're just putting you in
harm's way to protect myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't think that's
necessary.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would never make
orders like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can never be sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am sure.
And so are Lot and Ward.[A]
That's why we entrust our
lives to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't get cocky, kid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tee hee...[A]
[0408]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Hello, Ogier![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L-Lady Lilina![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't worry...[A]
I just wanted to talk
to someone from Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... All right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So talk to me.
Let's see...[A]
Tell me about
your hometown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My hometown?[A]
Well...it was a pretty
ordinary village.[A]
We were poor...[A]
The reason I came all the way to
the city in the first place[A]
was to make money to feed
my younger brothers...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have brothers?
How nice.[A]
Do you have any
sisters?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I have one younger sister, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
What's she like?[A]
Is she cute?
Is she like you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The...the last time I saw her was so
long ago, so I don't really remember.[A]
But I remember holding her hand.[A]
Her hand... It was so small and
delicate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's so sweet...[A]
I've always wanted
a younger sister.[A]
[0409]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Ogier, how is your
sister doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Is she back in your village?[A]
Or did she come to Ostia
with you?[A]
If she did, I'd like to...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry,
Lady Lilina, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tell me.
I'd love to meet her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
She's not around anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why not...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina...[A]
Our village is very poor.
...The men work.[A]
And girls...have no place.[A]
We have so little food
to spare...[A]
When a girl is born in our
village,[A]
she's given pretty clothes
and left in a faraway city.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...We couldn't afford her.[A]
I don't hold it against
my parents.[A]
If they hadn't done it...
we would have starved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry...
I...didn't know anything...[A]
I didn't know anything...
but I...I was so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]D-don't cry!
Please, Lady Lilina...[A]
[040A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOgier][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lady Lilina, about before...
I'm sorry.[A]
I said more than I should have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, Ogier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Milady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I had no idea.
But I can't remain ignorant as I am.[A]
I may not know how to govern yet,
but I'll learn.[A]
I will make Ostia a land where our
children can live in happiness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lady Lilina, some things
are impossible.[A]
Marquess Ostia served us well.
My brothers are all fine.[A]
Not even the gods can save
everyone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]But I can say this,
Lady Lilina...[A]
My sister, wherever
she is...[A]
I'm sure she would have
liked you very much.[A]
[040B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidLeft]Hmm... I need to work
on my twirls more...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Who's there?![A]
You! You saw my
secret training![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-no!
I didn't mean to![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Irrelevant![A]
Now that you've seen me,
I can't let you live.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-you're going to kill me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, I feel like I didn't
use that expression properly.[A]
Oh well. Anyway, it's really
embarrassing! That's what I meant.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm very sorry.
I didn't know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm... Well, I guess what's done
is done.[A]
Now that you've seen my dance, you
might as well tell me what you think![A]
So what did you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uhm... It was really pretty.[A]
And very...stimulating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you think so?[A]
I still haven't worked out the
main part yet.[A]
It gets really amazing towards
the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow... It does?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
Don't get any funny ideas
about what that means![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-what?!
I wasn't![A]
[040C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier][OpenMidLeft]Hmm...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Larum.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Oh, you're that guy
who was spying on me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Not exactly...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, you praised my dancing,
so I'll forgive you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You really like to dance,
don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess. It's fun.[A]
I meet a lot of people when
I travel around,[A]
and they all love my dancing.
That's what I like.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can understand that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, I know.[A]
Do you want me to show you the
rest of my dance from before?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]R-really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you want to see it?
You do, don't you?[A]
Tell me you want to see it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I want to see it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then sure, I guess I can
show it to you![A]
This is the sixth of the seven
dances I've mastered so far.[A]
And it's called...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dance Number 6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh. That's kind of...boring.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
Is that an insult?[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-no!
By no means.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it was![A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it wasn't![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, whatever![A]
Sorry, I changed my mind.
I won't show you my dance anymore![A]
[OpenMidRight]Aw, man...[A]
[040D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadOgier]
[OpenMidRight]Larum![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
Oh, I know.[A]
You just want to see
that dance, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your dancing...[A]
I think I've seen it
somewhere before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh? You have?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[A]
A small band of entertainers stopped
by my village once when I was younger.[A]
I went to watch them...and a little
girl was dancing in the center.[A]
She tripped a few times, but I could
tell she was trying really hard.[A]
I was going through some tough
times back then,[A]
but that girl's dancing really
cheered me up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
I don't remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I didn't think so.
But it was really nice.[A]
I'm sure you cheer people up with
your dancing wherever you go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, you're embarrassing me now!
But thanks, Ogier.[A]
Tell you what.[A]
I'll show you one of my
special dances some time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Special dances...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They're really amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...I bet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
You were getting funny ideas
again, weren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-no!
I wasn't![A]
[040E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidLeft]
Oh... Hello, Garrett.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You.[A]
I'm gonna be frank.
I don't wanna be your friend.[A]
...Wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You had an expensive-lookin'
bracelet on your wrist before.[A]
Where'd it go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You have keen eyes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you hafta when
you're a raider like me.[A]
Didja take it off or
somethin'?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I gave it away.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
You gave it away?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I met an old blind man on the
way here.[A]
He said that he was starving,
so I gave it to him...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, brother! You nobles
are so gullible![A]
He obviously tricked you.[A]
He made you pity him so
you'd give him money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...what if he was
telling the truth...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Listen kid, there's no way
he was tellin' the truth.[A]
He was laughin' at ya as
soon as ya walked away.[A]
You're soft. You don't
know the real world.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er... It was your bracelet,
though, so whatever...[A]
Do what ya want with
your own things...[A]
[040F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garrett.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
I told you before, I ain't
your friend.[A]
There's no tellin' what'll happen
to you if you stick around me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'll be fine.
You're a good person.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! Wouldja listen to that![A]
You think you can tell good
from bad?[A]
After you were tricked so
easily the other day?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...But...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm here for the money.[A]
If I don't get paid, I'll just
go back to bein' a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why don't you just
rob me right now, then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I have magic tomes, jewelry...
A lot of expensive items.[A]
You can sell it for money.
Nobody would see you...[A]
Why don't you just take all
my belongings and run off?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Why are you even talkin' to me
if you know I can do that?[A]
What if I really did it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then...I suppose I'm a fool.
But I don't think you would.[A]
I can sense that you're not
a bad person.[A]
I...trust you.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Arrgh![A]
[ToggleSmile]How could I rob her when she
looks at me like that...?[A]
[0410]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Garrett.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey...
Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said you gave your bracelet
to some blind guy, right?[A]
[ToggleSmile]What would you do if you met
him again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's the point in even askin'?
I already know what'd happen.[A]
You'd get tricked just like before.
You'd give him anything he wanted.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Why do you care so much
for total strangers?[A]
What do you get from
helpin' 'em?[A]
Just ignore 'em.
Who cares?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...When I see people in need,
I feel I need to help them.[A]
If I met that blind man again,[A]
I'd probably give him something...
just like before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...Oh well. I guess some
people are just born stupid.[A][Clear]
Oh yeah... Take this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is this for?[A]
Such a beautiful
bracelet...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I dunno.[A]
Some old guy came up to me the other
day and said he'd met you.[A]
He asked me to give it to you.[A]
He said that he was really
grateful for everything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But...I met that
old man way back in--[A]
[OpenMidRight]N-not like I'd know![A]
Anyway, he wanted me to give
it to you. Just take it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Garrett...[A]
[0411]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you're a
sailor, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? Yeah, I am.[A]
[OpenMidRight]D'you make a lotta
money as a sailor?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Well, I used to.
But now...not so much.[A]
I've had to stoop
to piracy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Never mind then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Did you
want something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was hopin' you might hire
me to work on your ship,[A]
but what's the point of goin'
from a bandit to a pirate?[A]
I...don't wanna rob for a
livin' anymore...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, not so fast.
I'm gonna quit piracy.[A]
It doesn't suit me anyway.[A]
I'm going back to being a
trader after the war ends.[A]
I could hire you to do odd jobs
around the ship if you want.[A]
[0412]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Garrett.[A]
Try spinning around
a few times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? Are you jokin'?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just think of it as
a sailor's test.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grr. Fine.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove].........[A][ToggleMouthMove]
All right, done.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Now try walking
over here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[MoveRight][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Whoa.[MoveRight][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're gonna get
seasick.[A]
You'll have to fix that if
you want to be a sailor.[A]
[OpenRight]What? A grown man, seasick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Age doesn't make any difference.[A]
I've seen plenty of grown men
puke their guts out.[A]
The outer seas can be
especially nasty.[A]
We sometimes come across storms
that could flip a ship over.[A]
Well, everyone gets used to it
after a month or so.[A]
[OpenRight]A month?[A]
I'm gonna be seasick for a
whole month?[A]
But it's not like we'll be at
sea the whole time, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course we will.
The ocean's huge.[A]
We sometimes don't even see
land for an entire year.[A]
[OpenRight]Whoa...[A]
Maybe I don't wanna do
this after all.[A]
[0413]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Fast cash isn't easy to
find, is it?[A]
Sailing sounds worse
the more I hear about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You think so?
The sea's wonderful.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But it's all water, right?[A]
It's just blue, blue,
blue wherever you look.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, the sea's not only blue.
Sometimes it turns gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's true.[A]
When the sun rises in the east...
or when it sets in the west...[A]
The whole ocean is illuminated
into a beautiful gold...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I prefer sunset over dawn
personally, though.[A]
There's nothing like sailing
into the setting sun...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you can't make any
money with a sunset.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You have no sense for majesty.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Tell you what. I'll let you on my
ship sometime.[A]
Once you see that beauty, you'll
understand what it is to be a sailor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But it won't put bread
on the table...[A]
[0414]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Eeeeeeek!
A bandit![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yep, I'm a bandit.
I won't hurtcha though.[A]
...Actually, I was wonderin'...
Do performers make good money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't be a bandit forever.[A]
I'm lookin' for a new line of work
that'll put food on the table.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
I'm not sure I'd say we
make GOOD money, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D'you think there's any kinda
performance I could do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know...
All I know is dancing, really...[A]
I might have a dance you could
do, though...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
Teach me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...
All right.[A]
Next time.
See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm countin' on ya...[A]
[0415]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidLeft]No, no! You've got
it all wrong![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-what?
It's like this, right?[A]
Step like this, and
then twirl...[A]
Am I doin'
somethin' wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just doing the moves isn't enough.
You have to have charm.[A]
With an expression like that
you'll send everyone running.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, well, this is my face.
I can't do anything about it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...?
Talking back, are we?[A]
Fine, I guess you don't want
me to teach you after all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ergh... O-OK, I got it...
Charm, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have to smile constantly.[A]
Come on, give it a try.
Let's see a smile...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]S-smile...
All right...[A][Clear][ToggleSmile]
Cheeeeeeeese...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha ha ha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What're you laughin' at?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, let's see,
what else...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I know.[A]
You need to use
your hips more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-my hips?! Look, I'm a big,
scary guy.[A]
Movin' my hips more'll
just make me look stupid![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...? Talking
back again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, all right!
I'll do it.[A]
I'll do anything you say!
Here... How's this?[A]
Am I movin' my hips
enough now?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Good!
That's perfect.[A]
Pfffha ha ha ha ha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I swear, you're just
playin' with me...[A]
[0416]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey!
Larum![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You made a fool of me![A]
You were teachin' me how
to dance, huh?[A]
It was nothin' but a
loada manure![A]
When I danced for the others
like you showed me,[A]
they all laughed at me like
I was some kinda idiot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Good![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?!
Why, you...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look. A performer's job is
to entertain.[A]
No matter how well you dance, it's
pointless if your audience is bored.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you want your audience to cry, you
have to shed tears.[A]
And if you want them to laugh, you
might have to look stupid.[A]
If the audience is having fun, I never
hesitate to make a fool of myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Slap me sideways.
You got a point...[A]
...I don't think dancin'
is for me, though.[A]
It's a lot harder than
I thought.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha...[A]
I thought you were
doing great.[A]
[0417]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You... You're
a bandit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hrngh? Yeah, I am.[A]
And you... You're a thief?
Hey, do thieves make decent--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shut up!
Stay away from me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]I hate bandits![A]
I wanna rip my eyes out
whenever I see them![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah? D'you think I care?[A]
Is that all you wanted to say?
You must be bored outta your mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...Huh. What was
that all about?[A]
[0418]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][LoadCath][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh.
You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, great. A bandit.
My day is ruined now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh.[A]
Like you're any different
from me. You steal too.[A]
You ain't got any right
to criticize me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hah, I only steal
from the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, so we're playin' the
the good thief, are we?[A]
That doesn't justify--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe not. I steal.
There's no denying that.[A]
But...I'd never, ever burn down a
village or hurt innocent people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...I...
I'm sorry.[A][ClearFace]
[0419]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][LoadCath][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]You again?
Urgh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you want?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a bandit. You're right.[A]
I've plundered villages and
hurt innocent people.[A]
But...lemme say just
one thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What could you possibly--?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...I hate bandits, too...[A]
And I hate myself for livin'
like one.[A]
That's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Maybe you're not such
a bad guy after all.[A]
[041A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh? Wha?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What the...?!
You an enemy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...I...
I Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wasn't askin' your name. I guess
you ain't an enemy, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...How'd they letchoo
into this army anyway?[A]
You're like the exact
opposite of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I mean, look at what yer wearin'!
You look like a total brigand.[A]
People'll run at the first sight
of ya.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I think you could
learn from me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Learn?
You?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What? You got a
problem with that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no...[A]
OK. I learn you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Professor Garrett.
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]P...
P...?[A]
Strange name...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look who's talkin'![A]
[041B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight]Hey. You want
somethin'?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
P...P...[A]
G...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Professor Garrett.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah... You that.
Here. I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! Guess you ain't
so useless after all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, my mom used to pick these in
the mountains when I was a kid.[A]
The bittersweet seeds are the
best part![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Mom...
You have parents.[A]
I not have...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not anymore I don't.[A]
My mom was killed in a bandit
attack when I was younger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I survived, though.[A]
I hunted down every single one of
those bandits and made them pay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It took me eight years.[A][Clear]
And now...I got nothin'
to show for it.[A]
I just...got nothin'
else to live for.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Grr... Why am I tellin'
this to you anyway?[A]
[041C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadGarret][OpenMidRight]Hey, Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...
P...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Professor Garrett.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah... You that.[A]
Here.
I give you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa, you kiddin'...?[A]
You didn't have to bring
the whole tree with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You like this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, yeah, but this is goin'
a little overboard...[A]
Ah, who cares. Thanks.
You want some?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No. I not eat
strange things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What's that
supposed to mean?[A]
Hm?[A]
...Looks like we better get goin'.
Come on, Gonzalez.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[A]
[041D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]You...[A]
You must be a pegasus
knight from Ilia.[A]
Pleased to meet you. I am
Alen, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Thea. But listen,
do you always--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So this is a pegasus?
I've never seen one up close.[A]
Its face is so cute.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow, thank you...
I mean, let me finish![A]
Do you always
fight like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So what if I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you think you're too rash?[A]
If you fight that way you can't
be sure you'll come out alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know my fighting style
can be dangerous.[A]
But, you see...[A][Clear]
Oh, chatting like this will
give the enemy an advantage.[A]
I must be alert. Farewell.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...There's something
wrong with him.[A]
[041E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Wait![A]
[OpenMidRight]Thea? Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Please, tell me. Why do
you fight like that?[A]
Your lanceplay leaves
you open...[A]
Why do you rely on brute
strength to attack?[A]
You won't be able to retaliate
properly that way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You've been watching
me, haven't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh? N-no...
Not you in particular![A]
It's just that...[A]
I can't ignore you when
you fight like that.[A]
That's all. Really.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyway, the point is, you should
fight more cautiously.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I understand your concern.
But I can't hold back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if you keep fighting
like that, you'll--[A]
[OpenMidRight]In battle, the first to match blades
with the enemy are us. The knights.[A]
The enemy will judge the entire army
by looking at how we fight.[A]
That's why I have to show them my
full power.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The slightest recoil will signal to
the enemy that we can be defeated.[A]
And what's more, my fellow knights
will see and may hesitate...[A]
That's why I charge ahead.[A]
I have to keep pushing forward.
For the army. For victory.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...That makes sense.[A]
...And here I thought you were
just a careless idiot...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did you say something
just now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No, nothing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, but I have
to fight like this.[A]
Still, I respect your
advice.[A]
Tell me more when you
have a chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Very well,
I suppose.[A]
[041F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You haven't changed your
fighting style, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thea.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long will you continue
fighting like that?[A]
I understand why you do...but if
you perish, that's the end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know that well.[A]
There is only so much
I can do on my own.[A]
But I am a knight,
so it is my duty...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If that's the case...then will
you allow me to stay by you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If...if I leave you on your own,
I worry and...I can't focus![A]
So I want to support you by
staying close.[A]
Or...am I not good enough
for you...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course you are![A]
You're strong, you can keep up
with my horse, and...[A]
With you around, it seems that
I always come out unharmed.[A]
I can trust you to guard my back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
You'll take me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course! You're a
strong warrior.[A]
I couldn't ask for a
better partner.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That...that's not
what I meant...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I mean...the point is...we'll be
together...and, I mean...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Never mind. Forget it...[A]
Well, come on, then. Let's go.
The battle awaits us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, we ride together![A]
[0420]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where's the next enemy...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alen.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have been performing
well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, you tend to charge
headfirst into enemy lines.[A]
Your duty is to protect
Lord Roy. You must think more.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Think more...? What's
there to think about?[A]
Defeating the enemy
protects Lord Roy![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What if an enemy made it past
you and Lord Roy was hurt?[A]
You wouldn't be able to make
it back to save him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's never happened...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you cannot deny that
it is a possibility.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What must I do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Take your time in battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take my time...?[A]
[0421]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alen.
What's troubling you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I need your guidance...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My guidance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You told me to take my time
in battle.[A]
Does that mean I've been fighting
wrong this whole time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not at all.[A]
But you only know one
way of fighting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's more than
one way...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your courage is not a bad trait.
Indeed, it is praiseworthy.[A]
I'm simply concerned you may leave
Lord Roy to fend for himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A knight must consider each
situation and adapt accordingly.[A]
Charging ahead is not always
the correct way.[A]
[0422]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Alen, your fighting
has improved.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks to you...[A]
I am trying to adapt my fighting
style to each situation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[A]
Hmm. You might be ready to
take over for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have grown old.[A]
I must make way for
the new generation.[A]
I trust Lord Roy will be
safe in your hands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you embarrassed to take
the place of an old man?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course not!
It would be an honor![A]
I shall protect Lord Roy with my
life and Pherae will prosper--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm yourself. Your passion
is all that worries me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just try to control your emotions.
Lord Roy is still young.[A]
You must grow with him. As a
knight, and as a person.[A]
[0423]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance!
How fares your sword today?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Neither good nor bad,
Alen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cool and calm as always,
I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I may have lagged behind you the
other day, but not in this battle![A]
Watch and learn from my skill,
Lance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I'll watch. We can all
learn from one another.[A]
Don't expect me to lower myself
to your level, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, look at you![A]
I look forward to sparring
when the battle's done.[A]
I'll be off then.
You'd better hurry along too.[A]
[0424]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alen, the battles will only get
more difficult from here on.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, but a challenge
is just what I want.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have something to
request of you. If we lose.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If we lose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
...If it ever looks like defeat is certain,
I want you to take Lord Roy and retreat.[A]
I will act as a decoy for the enemy
and buy you time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
But what about you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]If it has to be one of us,
it may as well be me.[A]
I've served House Pherae the
shortest, so--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you lost your mind?![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Alen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you're staying, then so will I.[A]
I won't allow you to run headfirst
into certain death alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're one of a long line of
knights serving House Pherae.[A]
It's better that you take
Lord Roy and flee.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How long you've served means nothing!
Let me ask you this.[A]
Do you consider yourself any less
loyal than the other knights?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]No answer? Then allow me.[A]
You're just as valuable as any of us![A]
You've held to your knightly
vows admirably![A]
I've been your partner ever since you
came to House Pherae so I know that well![A]
[OpenMidRight]Alen...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't throw your life away, Lance.
Lord Roy needs you. We all do.[A]
[0425]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alen, about before...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean about if we lose?[A]
Still intending to sacrifice yourself?
Or something even more ludicrous?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, you're right.
Your words were a slap in the face.[A]
Perhaps I was belittling myself because
I've served House Pherae the shortest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your work is second to none.[A]
Well, second to mine,
but that's a given.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where does your confidence come from?
I envy you sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm confident simply because I know
I could never lose to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'll make you eat those words
after I beat you today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hah, not likely![A]
See you after the battle![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even if we lose, you won't be
left behind! Remember that![A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
[0426]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...[A]
You're Ward,
the mercenary.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah...
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Alen, knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're one of our
client's knights.[A]
Are you any good?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right to the point...[A]
I will say that I consider
myself fairly skilled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, good.
Let's duel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, right now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.[A]
But I'm telling you now,
I won't go easy on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'd expect no less.[A]
Just don't start crying
if I hurt you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][LoadWard]
[OpenMidLeft]W...whoa...
You're better than I thought...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You too...
Good fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll beat you next time.
Got that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure thing![A]
[0427]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidRight]Hey, you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward!
How do you fare?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been looking for you.[A]
We didn't finish our
match yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh? I thought I won.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No way. I was just getting warmed up.
You haven't seen the real me yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No?[A]
[ToggleSmile]You haven't seen what
I can do, either![A]
[OpenMidRight]Bring it on![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlen][OpenMidLeft][LoadWard]
[OpenMidLeft]You are strong...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's call it a tie... Lance and
I used to spar like this a lot.[A]
It's great to have a partner
to train and grow with.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I haven't lost yet![A]
You'll see my true strength
next time, you hear?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.
Any time you're ready![A]
[0428]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlen][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Aaaarrr![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...![A][ToggleMouthMove]
You're...getting better, Ward![A]
[OpenMidRight]Y...you too![A]
You become stronger every
time we meet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm nothing.
It's just you who's weak.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Heh, whatever!
I'll beat you![A]
I'll crush all the
enemies with my axe...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Enemies...?[A]
Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you think
of this war?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think we can win?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?
Of course we'll win.[A]
I'm on this side, after all.
How could we lose?[A]
We've also got you.[A]
No one stands a chance
against the two of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha...
You're right.[A]
We can't lose.[A]
Enough talk!
Charge![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah!
Let's go get 'em![A]
[0429]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lance, have you gotten used
to serving House Pherae?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, Sir Marcus.[A]
Everyone has been very good to me despite
the fact that I'm an outsider...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.
That is good to hear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You have been very caring as
well, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course. I need
you especially.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?
Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You possess experiences the
other knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do I...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you do.[A]
Those traits will be of great help
to Lord Roy in the future.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[042A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Lance?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You said before that I had experiences
the other knights do not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That I did.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot see what those
experiences are.[A]
I am but a young knight.[A]
I think you see more in me
than there actually is.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think not.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will use what experience I have, but I
don't know that I can help especially.[A]
I served a different lord until just
recently, after all...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And that is it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is the experience the
others do not have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy will take the throne
of Pherae.[A]
If he is surrounded by only those
of Pherae, his views will lack scope.[A]
We need someone like you. You know
other parts of the world firsthand.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Will that experience...
really be of use?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You must make it so.[A]
Lord Roy must grow into an
individual with global views.[A]
[042B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLance][OpenMidLeft]Lance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Sir Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lord Roy said that you told him
stories of other lands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If my experience can be of use to Lord
Roy, then I will do my best to teach him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.[A]
Then it seems that I can
retire with no worries.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Marcus, what are you saying?
We still have much to learn from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not if we have you.[A]
You can take my place once
I am gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me? But I'm not even
a native of Pherae...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you still worrying
yourself over that?[A]
Lord Roy certainly isn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Very well. If you wish it, I shall
take your place when the time comes.[A]
But that won't happen for
many years.[A]
You are still well. You are an
example to us all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps. But we all must
step down eventually.[A]
[042C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are Lot the mercenary.
An axe-fighter of great endurance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You... You're Lance,
knight of Pherae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is something troubling you?
You have a worried look about you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I was just thinking
about something.[A]
Actually, this is perfect. Let me
ask your opinion on something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is within my meager
scope of knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, so, axes are
weak against swords.[A]
That much is common sense.[A]
What I'm wondering is why it's
that way to begin with.[A]
I don't understand the
physics behind it.[A]
That's what's troubling me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. I wondered the same
thing before.[A]
I found the answer after going
through several books on tactics.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it...the
weapon's weight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly.[A]
All weapons are designed by
humans.[A]
As such, an invincible weapon
with no flaws is inconceivable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're saying a weapon will
always have weaknesses.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[A]
Throughout history, many kinds of
weapons have been made,[A]
and the vast majority of them 
have fallen out of use.[A]
Of all of them, the sword, axe and lance
remain, creating the weapon triangle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But what about weapons like
the swordreaver?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, that brings us to a
whole new dimension.[A]
What I mean is... ............[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Ah, I see...
Then what about... ............[A]
[042D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Knight to F6.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Knight to E3.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pegasus knight to D1.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
Archer to B1.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Swordmaster to F1.[A]
Checkmate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...You win.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So it seems.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think it was a mistake
to move that ballista 6 turns ago?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so.[A]
Where did you learn how to play?[A]
It's a requirement for knights,
so that's how I learned it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]An old war veteran who lives
close to my home taught me.[A]
I could never find anyone to play
against in my mercenary groups.[A]
It looks like I'm but a novice
next to you, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, you can recognize your own
mistakes, so you have skill.[A]
I played with Alen the other day,
but it was over in 2 turns.[A]
[042E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLance][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you think
of this battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you think we stand
a chance of winning?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I honestly don't know.
We are severely outnumbered.[A]
The enemy can afford to send in new
troops all the time,[A]
while we must be careful not to
lose even a single soldier.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... We're almost on
completely different levels.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But Lord Roy often conceives genius
strategies beyond my understanding.[A]
He has commanded us miraculously
well thus far.[A]
Under his direction, I feel that
we cannot fail.[A]
Lord Roy will surely lead us to
a glorious victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
...You're not a yes man, thinking
so just because he is your lord.[A]
So if even you believe in him,
he deserves my faith...[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm certain we will succeed.[A]
[042F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval]
[OpenMidLeft]Perceval.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Cecilia.
Have your wounds healed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, somehow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[A]
...I'm sorry. I was there,
but I couldn't come to your aid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You did what you were supposed to.
Don't worry about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you...[A]
But it was a mistake
to follow Bern.[A]
I fight in this army to
atone for that mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure you've done more
than your share already.[A]
[0430]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,
Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That village we just passed...
It was in ruins.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes, it was.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Most of Elibe probably looks like
that now thanks to the war.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, probably...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We must put an end
to this conflict...[A]
We must defend those who
cannot defend themselves...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I agree.[A]
[0431]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia?
You look troubled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Perceval...[A]
I was just wondering what might
become of Etruria after all this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That is very much like you.
Always dutiful and loyal.[A]
...But I think there is only
one answer to that question.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And what's that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Etruria will regain its
former glory.[A]
It will become more prosperous
than ever before.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
We will make it happen
with our own hands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mustn't lose hope, Cecilia.[A]
If the Etrurian Generals give up,
then who will rebuild our country?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...
You're right, Perceval.[A]
[0432]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidLeft]Lord Perceval, if I may have
a moment of your time...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your Highness...![A]
You need not address
me with a title...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hush![A]
We can never know where
enemies may be hiding.[A]
Here, I am but a
simple bard. Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, fully.[A]
...What is it that
you need, Elffin?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Myrddin of Etruria passed
away last year.[A]
I'm curious about how the court
has been acting since then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Very well.
I will tell you what I know.[A]
After Prince Myrddin
passed away...[A]
[0433]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My Pr--
I mean, Elffin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is it,
Lord Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your father is still alive.
Have you seen him recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I have not seen him
in over a year.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you no intention of
seeing him at all?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Not until this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
Your father mourns for you,
thinking you long dead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I let my father know of my safety,
other people will find out as well.[A]
My father may be happy for a brief
moment,[A]
but he would soon suffer the grief
of losing me again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I must eliminate the root
of that grief.[A]
Only then will I go to see
my father.[A]
[0434]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Elffin.[A]
You were talking about songs
for your future travels...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The songs about the state of Etruria
since the passing of the prince?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, those.[A]
Will you sing them all across the
continent when the war ends?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That is my intention, yes.[A]
I travel not only to sing,
but to learn as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Will you be visiting the
Etrurian palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course I will.[A]
I expect my stay in Etruria
to be the longest of all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And where will you go after
you visit the palace?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nowhere...[A]
I intend to stay and sing for the
Kingdom of Etruria until my death.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Have I your word?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I swear on my honor.[A]
[0435]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidLeft]General Perceval.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're...Larum,
if I recall correctly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Look, look![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Watch me dance![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Well?
How was it?[A]
Did it grasp you?[A]
I think this twirl
really does the trick...[A]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Are you always like that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So carefree...[A]
Or should I say...
disoriented?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Aww...
Thanks![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[0436]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidLeft]What did you think this time,
General Perceval?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Larum.
I was wondering...[A]
Why do you always show
me your dancing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you enjoy seeing
me dance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To be perfectly honest...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't care for it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...You don't care
for it...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]You...[A]
You cruel, cruel man!
I never want to see you again![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[0437]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerceval][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...... ......[A]
...... ......[A]
...... ......[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Odd...[A]
She was nothing but a nuisance,
but now that she's gone, I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][ToggleSmile]...Feel lonely?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Really?
I knew it![A]
I knew you liked
having me around![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't lie.[A]
You said you felt
lonely without me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...No, actually,
I didn't say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew it, I knew it![A]
Not even General Perceval can live
without my dancing.[A]
I'll come to your quarters and give
you wake-up dances every morning![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You seem to be beyond
my comprehension.[A]
[0438]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight]Sophia, are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Oh...
Igrene... Yes...[A]
I'm fine...
I'm just a little dizzy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't work yourself too hard
if you're not feeling well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I know...[A]
The outside world...
is so vast...[A]
It's enough...
to excite me a bit...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you've never seen civilization
outside of Arcadia like this.[A]
Ask me if you have any questions...[A]
I know the outside world fairly well,
so I can explain things for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, thank you...[A]
[0439]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Igrene...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um... What is this?
I found it...on the ground...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Let's see...[A]
Oh, this is a quarrel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A what...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Quarrels are large arrows
used in ballistae.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They fire these...?
They're so big....[A]
But...it's strange...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The people living outside...[A]
They make such amazing creations...
and they are so advanced...[A]
And yet...why do they continue
to fight?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]They're...much smarter than us,
so...[A]
one would think they would know...
that war is pointless...[A]
...It is puzzling...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes...[A]
You're right.
It is strange...[A]
[043A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh?[A]
You seem to be in
a good mood, Sophia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
I was speaking...to the other
people in the army...[A]
The people living outside...
are all so kind...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's nice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I would like...if we could be
friends...with the outsiders...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me too...[A]
But the elder forbids
contact with outsiders.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can understand why, though...[A]
The dragons' power could easily
destroy entire countries.[A]
If the outsiders learn of their existence,
they will surely fight over them.[A]
I've seen many conflicts like that
in my life...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... But...
perhaps someday...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe so...[A]
If we in Arcadia can live
together with dragons,[A]
there's no reason outsiders
can't learn to do the same...[A]
[043B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe my
eyes...![A]
Could it...could it
really be you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sorry, what? I don't know
what you're talking about.[A]
I'm Astolfo. Just a
petty thief.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You look just like him...[A]
You look so much like...
my husband...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your husband?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I lived with him in Arcadia.[A]
...But one day he left
without saying a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh. And he looks exactly
like me?[A]
Well, they say everyone has an
exact double somewhere out there.[A]
Best you forget about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Let me see your leg.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, whoa,
what're you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I first found him
collapsed in the desert.[A]
The heat had gotten to him, and
he'd lost his memory.[A]
He had blade wounds all over
his body,[A]
but he had a particularly bad
injury on his leg.[A]
It never fully healed, and it
left a scar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm not your man.[A]
My legs are clean. I don't have
any gross scars like that.[A]
I really have to get going.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[043C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]You again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you...are you
really not him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No way. But hey, for what it's
worth, I can't believe that guy.[A]
Dumping a gorgeous gal like you.
What a chump.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Please, let me tell
you about him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.
I can do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]His name was Gorlois.[A]
We started to live together as
I nursed him back to health.[A]
We lived happily for
several years.[A]
Slowly, his memory started
returning.[A]
I was happy, but also...scared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]One day, bandits attacked Arcadia.[A]
Gorlois left to fight them off
but he never came back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]The corpses of the bandits all sank
into the quicksand.[A]
I couldn't find Gorlois, so I
assumed the same happened to him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, there you go.
There's your story.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I couldn't help but think in the bottom
of my heart that he might yet live.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah. Wishful thinking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...if he were alive, he wouldn't
have disappeared without a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He's probably living a pretty
miserable life now anyway.[A]
I say you forget about him
and move on.[A]
Hey, I know.[A]
I can give you a kiss in his place
if it'll make you feel better...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow. She didn't have to slap me...
Sigh...[A]
[043D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadIgrene][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's you. The rejected man
will slink away now...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Gorlois...![A]
...I mean, Astolfo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Please, look at this...[A]
My husband had it when
I first met him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What is this doodle?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's not a doodle.[A]
It's a seal given to
Lycian spies.[A]
I also did some research on
what kind of work they do...[A]
And...now I understand...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Spies carry information
dangerous to their enemies.[A]
If a spy is caught, the enemy
will exploit any weakness.[A]
Family and loved ones are
often taken hostage...[A]
And the spy is tortured until he
spills every bit of information.[A]
That's why a spy must be alone...[A]
He must have no family, friends,
or loved ones...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I'm sorry, but...
that guy is dead.[A]
He was devoured by the
quicksands of Nabata.[A]
All this stuff about spies...
It's just your imagination.[A]
Or maybe the desert heat made
you see things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yes... It must have
been a dream...[A]
A wonderful dream...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Igrene.
...I...[A][Clear]
Sorry, forget it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseSpeechFast]Just...forget about me.
...Please.[A]
[043E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Hello, Marcus.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Lady Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Things grow more
perilous all the time...[A]
Marcus, do you think Roy
will be OK?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course, milady.[A]
Lord Roy takes after his father,
the greatest knight in Lycia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes... Lord Eliwood is a
great knight indeed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]His wife was also a kind,
gentle woman.[A]
Much like yourself,
if I may say so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow...
Do you really think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Roy is becoming very much
like his father.[A]
I expect him to seek a wife
much like Lord Eliwood's.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like his mother...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Milady, if you would allow me
a suggestion.[A]
When all is done and we return to
Lycia, you and Lord Roy should w--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus![A]
Roy and I are friends.
Just friends![A]
It's too soon to think
of marriage![A]
[043F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Marcus, what kind of couple were
Lord Eliwood and his wife?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, milady, just looking at them
would fill one with cheer.[A]
The people of Pherae were truly
happy for them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That sounds nice...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Eliwood loved his wife deeply.[A]
One night...before the two were
wed, Lord Eliwood disappeared.[A]
He returned three days later, and
presented his wife a flower.[A]
It was a beautiful white flower that
grows only in the snowy highlands.[A]
And it was the flower she loved
the most.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lord Eliwood sounds so...
romantic. Sigh...[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]And look at Roy...[A]
[0440]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarcus][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What troubles you,
Lady Lilina?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Marcus...[A]
What does...what does
Roy think of me?[A]
I...I'm not so
sure anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Roy... He's...
I've always...liked him....[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why not ask him yourself,
milady?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do not know much of these matters,[A]
but the maids in the castle say that
women can no longer be passive.[A]
I'm certain Lord Roy would fall
for you if you were to advance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Yes...
That's what I'll do.[A]
I've known him longer
than anyone.[A]
I won't let someone
else snatch him up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit,
Lady Lilina![A]
[0441]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]Hello, Astolfo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, if it isn't Lady Lilina.
Your beauty is a sight to behold.[A]
In fact, I think it's rubbing off
on me. My wrinkles are fading. See?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Astolfo...
You haven't changed at all.[A]
My father always said you'd be better
at your job if you were more serious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll hear no arguments
from me, milady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...By the way, how did you
meet my father?[A]
He never told me anything...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It really wasn't a meeting you'd
go around telling people about.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was a petty thief back then.[A]
I decided to creep into Castle Ostia
to swipe some treasure, see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
...Whoops, we really shouldn't
be wasting time like this.[A]
Forgive me, milady, but I'll tell
you the story some other time.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
I guess I can wait...[A]
[0442]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidLeft]...It was easy getting to
the treasure vault.[A]
I'm an expert at picking locks
and all that, after all.[A]
Once I'd grabbed all the goodies
and made my way out, bam![A]
There was a man, standing right
in front of me.[A]
And wouldn't you know, that
man was--[A]
[OpenMidRight]My father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You got it. Lord Hector just
stood there, staring at me.[A]
He didn't seem angry
or anything.[A]
You could tell he was important
just by looking at him.[A]
Me? I was frozen on the spot, with
bags of loot over my shoulders.[A]
Would he call the guards?[A]
Would he cut me down right then
and there?[A]
My mind was racing, trying to
figure out what was coming up...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He suddenly burst out
laughing, milady.[A]
"Quite a man to get through my
security so easily," he said.[A]
Then he asked my name. I was
speechless, mouth open.[A]
Lord Hector then offered me
the job of serving him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought he was out of his mind.
But I could tell he was serious.[A]
Anyway, I wasn't up for it and ran
for the door with the treasure.[A]
And then...[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And then Lord Hector...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? What did he do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Whoops, sorry, milady,[A]
[ToggleSmile]I should really get going.
I'll finish the story later.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Again?
Sigh...[A]
[0443]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAstolfo][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina]
[OpenMidLeft]Lord Hector...[A]
He didn't budge even when he
saw me start to run.[A]
So I made a mad dash.[A]
I was almost at the door, but Lord
Hector was still just standing there.[A]
I was confused, so I turned and
yelled at him,[A]
"I'm getting away with your treasure!
You're not going to do anything?!"[A]
A heavy voice responded. "Flee if you
wish. You have earned the treasure.[A]
But is that what you want in life?
To live in fear in the shadows?"[A][Clear]
I ran like a madman, milady. I fled
from the castle, from his booming voice.[A]
I didn't know what to do with myself,
so I wandered around aimlessly all night.[A]
At the break of dawn...I found myself
back at the front of the castle.[A][Clear]
And Lord Hector was there waiting
for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I worked for him ever
since, milady.[A]
He changed my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So that's what happened...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lady Lilina, I will never
be ashamed to say this.[A]
Your father...was the most
honorable man I've met.[A]
[0444]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]
So, who's next?![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
Hey! Shanna![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Ward.
What's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Don't buzz about the
front lines so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Buzz about?!
Am I an insect?![A]
[OpenMidRight]You might as well be! Archers sure
make short work of you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah?![A]
Then you're an ape, you
stupid, slowpoke axefighter![A]
You can't even dodge![A]
[OpenMidRight]Say that again![A]
You pickin' a
fight with me?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You started it, you idiot![A]
[ToggleSmile]But fine, you're on! Just try and
hit me all the way up here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey... Shanna!
No fair![A]
Get down here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, right!
Catch me if you can![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Blast it![A]
She really knows how
to set me off![A]
[0445]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft]Yaaawn...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Too soon to relax,
stupid.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ow![A]
Hey! You hit me![A]
What did you do
that for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There was an enemy archer
taking aim from the bushes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]And here you are,
yawning it up. Idiot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Idiot?[A]
You have no right to call
anyone an idiot, let alone me![A]
[OpenMidRight]I dunno, someone who decides to kick back
in a battle seems pretty idiotic to me.[A]
You're just lucky I happened to pass by.[A]
You'd be vulture food by now if
not for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph, I can take care of a
single archer no problem.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Do you want a favor or something?
I don't need you watching my back.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, is that so!
Then pardon me![A]
I'll just sit back and watch
you from now on, then.[A]
Good luck! Hope ya don't die![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]That idiot![A]
I didn't even have a
chance to thank him...[A]
[0446]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Where did she go?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Ward.[A]
What are you
doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I told you to leave this
area to me.[A]
That means you don't go
flying around on your own![A]
We have to follow Roy's
orders...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But if we sit around waiting for
orders all the time,[A]
we could miss an opportunity![A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you get it?![A]
What if you flew out by yourself
into a bunch of enemy archers?![A]
Why don't you just think before
you act...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
I thought you were angry about
me fighting without you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![A]
We need to work as
a team in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then what was all that about
the archers and stuff?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh![A]
Th-that was...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Were you worried about me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-w-what are you talking about?!
N-n-no way![A]
Y-you just don't know how to
act in battle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ward, you're stuttering.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Err...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ward.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Oh, c'mon. You're not
supposed to say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
You're right.[A]
[0447]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, who's next!
Bring it on![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ward, can't you calm
down a bit?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What's that?
You scared, Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not likely![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
I rush in, and you do
everything else.[A]
That's worked great
so far.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mary asked me to take
care of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My sister said that?
I'm not a kid anymore...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I wish that were true.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, nothing.[A]
[0448]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidRight]Ward, you seem to be
doing well today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course!
I'm always great.[A]
You better fight
hard, too, buddy.[A]
You need money to buy
medicine for your mother...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't need to
anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My mother, she...[A]
She didn't make it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
Why didn't you
tell me?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Because if I did, you'd tell
me to go home to Mieu.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
No kidding!
She's all alone now.[A]
Don't you care about your
baby sister?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But I got the message
during a job.[A]
I couldn't leave
without finishing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're stupider
than I thought.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
[0449]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWard][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ward, you're acting
strangely as of late.[A]
Do you have something
to say to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lot.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't die.[A]
Whatever you do,
don't die.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you're killed,
what will happen to Mieu?[A]
She's just a little girl.
She'll be forced to live on her own.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you're no different.[A]
Mary would be devastated
if you were killed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, sure, like she
would cry over me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You can't honestly
think that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]It's not just me that
can't die here.[A]
It's both of us.[A]
One day, we'll go
back home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's just a dirty village with no
clean water or vegetation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe so, but it's our home, and we
both have people waiting for us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, you're right.
Let's not disappoint them![A]
[044A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can tell by your face.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Really? That's actually
kind of impressive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back to your
hometown after the war?[A]
If you are, I could use
your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help with what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning to build a new village for
people who lost their homes in the war.[A]
I can't do it myself, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you
want me to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, there are plenty of things
you could do.[A]
Chop firewood, clean the laundry,
help with cooking...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm no servant.
I live the mercenary life.[A]
Sorry, but you better ask
someone else...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You'll help us? Fantastic!
I knew you would.[A] 
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, that's not what I said!
Were you even listening?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sure I was. But I can
tell that you want to.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I don't![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see in your eyes
your desire to help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No you can't![A]
[044B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again...
I'm not helping, all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trust me, you don't want to be
a mercenary.[A]
You never know when you
could die.[A]
And you're weak, so that'll be
sooner rather than later.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grr... You'll regret
saying that...[A]
You don't want to see
me when I'm angry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you looking at me
like that for?![A]
I've slain monsters stronger
than any human![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, now that's something.[A]
What kind of beasts?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Near my village...
there's this weird cave.[A]
When I was a kid, people said
it was filled with monsters.[A]
So one day I got my friend Lot
and we went to defeat them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The cave was dark and damp...
Something seemed wrong.[A]
Lot was scared, but I was fine.[A]
I led the way...and finally,
there they were.[A]
The monsters were crawling all
over the cave floor.[A]
Long, skinny bodies slithering
about, all scaly and spotted...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Snakes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess they were kind of like snakes.
But these were no ordinary snakes.[A]
They were monsters, with poison and
strange dances and weird moves...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah... Snakes.
Anyway, where is this cave?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'll go check it out on my
way to the village site.[A]
I'm curious now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]B-but I already killed
all the monsters...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You said they were all over
the cave floor.[A]
Some might have escaped. They were
no ordinary snakes, right?[A]
I want to see them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grr...[A]
[044C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadWard][OpenMidLeft]Well, we meet again.[A]
Doesn't looking at my face
make you want to help out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No.[A]
...But...[A][ToggleSmile]
When the war is over, I might
just stop by my old home.[A]
And if I get bored, maybe I'll
come and help a little.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you have family
back home?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, an older sister who never
stops yelling at me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sigh...[A]
You're pretty stupid,
you know that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Stupid?[A]
What do you mean
by stupid, you--[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You've got a home to return to.[A]
You've got someone waiting
for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Help us out if you have time,
but your sister is more important.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, yeah, I know...[A]
Can't wait for her
to scold me again...[A]
[044D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, don't come out
front so often.[A]
Pegasi are easy prey
for archers.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And you're frail, so make sure
you retreat from danger.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lot! You're such a worrywart.
I am a knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you're still
in training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, yeah, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just remember that you can never
be overly cautious in battle.[A]
Staying wary will keep you alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, yeah.[A]
[044E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, you can't always
charge in like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But Lot...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No buts.
You should be more--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why are you always so
concerned about me?[A]
Oh wait, I get it.[A][Clear]
Aww, I never knew you felt
that way about me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, you wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's not it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I have a little sister back home.[A]
[OpenMidRight]A sister?[A]
Does she look like
me or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, not in the slightest.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's a lot younger than you.
She isn't even ten years old.[A]
That's why I worry like I do,
fighting in battles like this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Shanna, you have an
older sister, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, two actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then take care of yourself.
If not for your sake, then for them.[A]
Imagine how they'd feel if
something happened to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... You're right.
I'll be more careful.[A]
[044F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLot][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Hey, Lot![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna.[A]
You seem to be doing
well lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm being more careful now.
I don't rush in anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, not as much as
before, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Shoot, that means I can still
improve, doesn't it...?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh yeah, I had something
I wanted to tell you, too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Something to tell me?
What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
A tip for battle!
Do you want to hear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then give me your ear
for a sec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK...
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Don't stress yourself
out so much, Brother.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What the...?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That was from your cute
little sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're from the
Western Isles, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah...
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Easy. Your face.[A]
All men from the Isles
have features like yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...They do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you going back home
after the war?[A]
If you are, I could
use your help.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm planning on building a new
village in the Western Isles.[A]
It'll be for people who lost
their homes during the war.[A]
I want you to help build it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, I'll do
what I can...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?
Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't make any
promises.[A]
I can only help if I'm still
alive when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Talking like that already?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I only say it because it's
a distinct possibility.[A]
I'm not one to make empty
promises...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You sure worry a lot for
someone your age.[A]
You'll be getting gray hairs
before thirty at that rate.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[A]
[0451]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft]Hey, it's you again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're the one who wanted
to build the village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The planning's going
along smoothly.[A]
A free village,
open to anybody...[A]
It's like a dream
coming true.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you have the money
to build it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You want logistics now, eh?[A]
To tell the truth... No.[A]
But there are mines in the Isles,[A]
so I just need to go in and find
the mother lode.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That seems pretty unlikely...[A]
...Oh, wait.[A]
I know of an old, deserted
gold mine you could try.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I went there with my
friend Ward when I was a kid.[A]
There were rumors that the place
was haunted, so nobody went near it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Go on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ward was really scared.
He probably believed the rumors.[A]
We went in a ways, and Ward let out
a scream and ran for the entrance.[A]
So I followed him out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did he see something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, snakes.[A]
Tons of them.[A]
They covered the whole
cave floor.[A]
What I want to know is how they
got there in the first place...[A]
But anyway, the mine was
closed because of them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see... So there might still
be some gold left in there.[A]
Sounds interesting.[A]
We might get enough money for
the village there.[A]
Say, can you take me when
you get the chance?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't mind...
But it'll be dangerous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm not worried.[A]
You'll be there to protect us.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I will?[A]
[0452]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLot][OpenMidLeft]Hey, how are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Still alive, at least.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you die.
I need you to survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't plan on dying.
I have a sister back home.[A]
And there's also...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Also what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing. Never mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I get it.[A]
You've got a special somebody
waiting for you, eh?[A]
Well, well, aren't you a
lucky guy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I want to go home as soon as
I can, provided I'm alive...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you worrying about
that again?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The enemies get stronger
all the time.[A]
I don't know how much
longer I'll last.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm confident that we'll win
in the end...[A]
But I just don't know
that I'll make it home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come on, don't
be stupid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm stupid now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Someone your age should be
enjoying life![A]
I know you have your sister
to think of.[A]
But let yourself go once
in a while.[A]
You might get a few cuts
and bruises, but that's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't like cuts
and bruises.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. If you die,
I'll take care of things.[A]
[ToggleSmile]So go out and get killed!
It'll be fine.[A]
...Trust me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Somehow I don't think that came
out like she intended it to...[A]
Was she...trying to cheer me up?[A]
[0453]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So...you're Gonzalez.[A]
I hear you've been quite a
nuisance in the Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you fight for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I want
fight with everyone.[A]
But...I useless.[A]
I become strong,
everyone like me.[A]
Become strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...
Very well. I'll train you.[A]
First, I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hit?
I can't...[A]
Hurt you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah...?
Take this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Ugh.[A][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez]Wh-why you hit me?[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]You think your puny fists can
hurt ME?! Now hit me![A]
[OpenMidRight]O-OK...[A]
Raaah![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]Oof...[A][MoveFarFarLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre]Yeah...
You're pretty strong.[A]
But it's my turn now!
After I sit down for a minute...[A]
[0454]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez.[A]
Are you keeping up
with your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look. I find this.
I have money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you do.
What of it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I become strong.
I buy armor.[A]
I not get hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh yeah...?
Take this![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]Ugh.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]Offense is everything![A]
If you beat your enemy in a single hit,
he won't even have a chance to hit back![A]
Only puny worms wear armor![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez]O-OK...
I wrong.[A]
I beat enemy in one hit.
I buy strong axe.[A]
[OpenLeft]Oh yeah...?[A]
Take this![A]
[OpenMidRight]Egh.[MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][A]
[OpenLeft]You think that a good weapon
makes you strong?[A]
A true warrior fights with
the raw strength of his muscles![A]
Don't waste your time buying
weapons! Build your muscles![A]
Build them up so big that you can
crumble walls with a rusty iron axe![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez]O-OK...[A]
[0455]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You needn't say anything, Gonzalez.
I can tell by looking in your eyes.[A]
You've become strong.[A]
You've come a long way from the little
weakling you were when we first met.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know what you're going
to say, Gonzalez.[A]
And you're welcome.
It was my pleasure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you still have a
long way to go.[A]
The path to true warriorhood
is hard and neverending.[A]
Now come, Gonzalez.[A]
Let us train until we can tear
down the very sky above![A]
[OpenMidRight]I...[A]
[0456]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hmm...[A]
So this is a wyvern. It has a
face only a mother could love.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You are...
Bartre?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That I am.[A]
Young man, do you mind if I
touch this creature?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, maybe now's not
the best time...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?
Hmm?![A]
Why you...[A]
You want a fight,
do you?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Levrey, down![A]
[OpenMidLeft]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, he's been a little
tense since training earlier...[A]
Are you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm fine.[A]
Say, young man, you have
quite some talent.[A]
You've managed to tame this
beast at your young age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, any wyvern rider
can do that much...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Have some pride.
You have talent.[A]
Ah, yes, you said you
were training earlier?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I've been trying to get some
speed in our offense.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're already a powerful wyvern rider,
yet you seek even more strength.[A]
Now that's a real man.
I wish you luck.[A]
[0457]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, young man.[A]
Have you been continuing
your training?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very good.
Men must be strong in body.[A]
Men are getting softer and
softer as time passes.[A]
Why, in battle I see grown men
lagging behind little girls![A]
It's disgraceful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er, yes...[A]
We all must become stronger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, we think alike it seems...[A]
My daughter left home recently.[A]
I've been wondering if perhaps
I didn't discipline her enough...[A]
It's been bothering me for
several days now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I, uh...
I'm sorry to hear that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's good to talk with
someone full of such insight![A]
[0458]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We get along well.[A]
I feel I am at my strongest
when I fight beside you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, when you're nearby I
feel I have nothing to fear.[A]
It's like...an unstoppable
force is protecting me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I had a son, I would have raised
him into a fine young man like you.[A]
You are indeed the perfect match
for my daughter.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]From now on, think of me as your father.
Feel free to tell me anything.[A]
Is that clear, my son?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah...
Thank you, I think.[A]
[0459]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My name's Cath!
You're Bartre, right?[A]
Do you mind if we
talk for a bit?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure, I don't
see why not.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[A]
You look a lot like
my father, actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah. He's nothing
like you, though.[A]
He's a disgusting
coward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, that's not
like me at all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Talking with you 
reminds me of him.[A]
Bartre, do you think you can hug
me like my father used to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.
Like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that's it, Bartre.
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Any time.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
Heh... What an idiot.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Just like my father.[A]
[045A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Bartre.
Here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...?
This is my axe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah. And you see
all this other stuff?[A]
It's yours. I stole
it from you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I'll
be darned...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yup, I'm a thief.[A]
I trick people so I
can steal their stuff.[A]
Well? You gonna
yell at me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Cath. Why are you
telling me this?[A]
You could have gotten
away with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know.[A]
I don't even know why I stole
from you in the first place.[A]
I usually only steal from
the rich.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Does it have something
to do with your father?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe.
I hate my father.[A]
He's such a coward...
I hate his guts.[A]
[045B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBartre][OpenMidRight][LoadCath]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...My village was burned to
the ground in the war.[A]
A bunch of soldiers came and ordered
us to set our houses on fire.[A]
No one listened... I mean,
who would? They were our homes.[A]
The soldiers got impatient and
drew their weapons...[A]
That's when one of the villagers took
a torch and lit everything on fire.[A]
That villager...was my father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]All of our houses and crops
were burned to the ground...[A]
My father did nothing but
stand there and watch...[A]
I've hated him ever since.[A]
I swore to myself that I would never
mindlessly bow to power like him.[A]
That's why I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cath... You're wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No one would burn their
own village down by choice.[A]
Your father...had something
he felt he needed to protect.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Your father didn't have the
strength to defeat the soldiers.[A]
But he was fighting all the same.[A]
He forced himself to burn his
home and crops,[A]
all to protect something
more important.[A]
He was protecting you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...Ha...[A]
Not likely.
He's just a coward.[A]
[ToggleSmile]He's nothing like you.[A]
But...maybe it's better to
think he was protecting me...[A]
[045C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight]Raigh! Raigh![A]
[ToggleSmile]Can you hear me,
Raigh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh]...Yes, I can hear you. You don't
have to shout like that.[A]
...What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Here.[A]
That's your share.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[A]
What are these?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Baked tarts.[A]
The man who delivers our meals
gave me some extra ones.[A]
They look good, don't they?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sweets...
They're hard to find nowadays.[A]
Savor them and eat them
for yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's no fun if I eat
them alone.[A]
Let's eat them together
a little later.[A]
Anyway, I have to
go now.[A][ClearFace]
[......][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh]Oh, one more thing.[A]
You should at least respond
when you're spoken to![A]
I don't mind that much, but
strangers might get ideas.[A]
They might think that you're
antisocial or something.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, they'd be right.[A]
...But whatever.[A]
My dear brother is as
naive as ever.[A]
[045D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Raigh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you doing all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What do you mean,
"all right"?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was a little worried that
you'd left again.[A]
The first time was so sudden.[A]
You just left a note and
disappeared.[A]
I thought you might have walked
off again without a word...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Lugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your note said you wanted to train
your dark magic skills alone.[A]
Was I...in your way?
You didn't want me around...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no, that's not it...[A]
I always planned to come back once
I became a powerful shaman.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I knew it, Raigh![A]
I knew you'd come back
for the children![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?
No, that's not--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm so relieved!
You haven't changed at all.[A]
You're still the kind-hearted
Raigh I know and love.[A]
I'll go pray![A]
I'm going to thank the gods
for letting me see you again![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh... Bye, I guess?[A]
...Sigh...
Why is he like that?[A]
[045E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, I need to tell
you something.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it, Raigh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I...I'm sorry I left the orphanage
without saying anything.[A]
I...uh...I want to apologize
for that...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's all right now.[A]
I understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A-and one more thing![A]
I'll never disappear without
telling you again![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Great.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So will you stop hovering
around me all the time?[A]
Come on. Please!![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you dislike
being near me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er...[A]
N-no, not exactly,
but...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then what's the problem?[A]
Who knows if we'll still be
together when we grow up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Lugh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If...[A]
If I don't make it through this war,[A]
promise me you'll pick up the
children at the St. Elimine Church.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't say that.
We'll both survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah... You're right.[A]
Something's wrong with me today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I won't let you die.[A]
You're my brother.
My only brother.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Raigh.[A]
[045F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh... H-hey. You're Lugh, right?[A]
I, uh, I'm sorry I mistook you
for your brother the other day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, Hugh, it's all right.[A]
We're twins, so no one can
really tell us apart anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh man, I'm really sorry, though.[A]
I can't believe I just lost it and
grabbed you by the collar like that.[A]
I'm a terrible person.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...But it was Raigh's fault for
running off with your spell tome.[A]
I should be apologizing to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, never mind that.[A]
It was my fault for letting
my guard down anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But...[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Yeah, you're right, never mind.[A]
That whole business let us meet
each other, so it's not that bad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah! We're both mages, so
let's help each other along![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, actually, I was hoping that
you would teach me some things.[A]
[0460]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hugh![A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
What do you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your elbow's bleeding![A]
We have to wrap it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I got hit in that
last fight.[A]
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes it is![A]
You can't leave a
wound like that alone...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lugh?
You look a little pale...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I've lost enough people
I care about already.[A]
...I'll treat your wound.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
All right, thanks.[A]
[0461]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lugh, about before...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry![A]
You said you were all right,
but I just ignored you and...[A]
I'm sure you don't like it when kids
act like they know more than you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
Don't apologize for helping me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But you seemed to be avoiding me,
so I thought you were mad...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I was embarrassed,
that's all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because...[A]
No one ever cared for me that
much my whole life...[A]
My nana raised me, but
she's a real kook.[A]
She's given me injuries way
worse than this one,[A]
but she never once used her
staves to heal me![A][ToggleSmile]
I was just happy to have someone
concerned about me for a change...[A]
Thanks, man.[A]
You're my new best friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, Hugh!
Let's be friends forever!![A]
[0462]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMelady]
Whew... Sorry to work you
so hard, Tryffin... Good girl.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLugh]Wow![A]
A wyvern![A]
Wow, it's so big![A]
Is this wyvern
yours?[A]
Will it get angry
if I touch it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, go ahead.
She's a gentle one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, such hard scales...
Her fangs are so sharp too![A]
Amazing...
Are you a wyvern rider?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I am.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?![A]
I thought only Bern
had wyvern riders![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]![A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]They say Bern's wyvern riders are
unbeatable, so I was a little nervous...[A]
But they're nothing if we have
wyvern riders on our side, too![A]
I want to defeat Bern, but I'm
not very good with my magic yet,[A]
so I can't do all that much on
my own...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Oh... I better get going.
See you later![A]
Thanks for letting me
pet your wyvern.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes... See you...[A]
[0463]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello![A]
Can I give this to your wyvern?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hello.
What are those?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I got some extra baked tarts, so I
wanted to give some to the wyvern.[A]
Oh wait, do wyverns even eat
food like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You love them, don't you, Tryffin?
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]She's called Tryffin?
Can I call her that, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Here you go, Tryffin.
Eat up.[A]
Good, aren't they?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...What is your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
I'm Lugh from Lycia.
What's your name?[A]
Where are you from?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm Melady.
...I come from Bern.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]!!![ToggleMouthMove][A][......]
...You're joking, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry. I couldn't get
myself to say it sooner...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Wait!
Lugh![A][.......][Clear]
...I know it was inevitable,
but still...[A]
I'm sorry, Tryffin. Just when you
had made a little friend...[A]
[0464]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft][LoadLugh][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Madam Melady.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lugh![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I'm sorry I ran off
like that before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's all right.[A]
I'm glad you're speaking
to me again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I didn't want things to
end like that.[A]
[ToggleSmile]...Will you listen to
my story?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My parents died when I was four,[A]
and ever since then I'd been
living at an orphanage in Lycia.[A]
It was tiny, with only seven kids and
one priest who we all called Poppa.[A]
The oldest kids were Chad and my twin
brother Raigh and I,[A]
so we three took care of the younger
children.[A]
We were poor, but we were happy
anyway.[A]
But after Bern started this war,
our lives began to change.[A]
Food started getting scarce, and we
sometimes had to resort to begging...[A]
Chad... He started stealing food
without telling Poppa...[A]
Raigh got fed up with that lifestyle
and left one day without a word.[A]
I hated Bern... We all did.[A]
Bern was responsible for everything...
Bern killed Poppa...[A]
I just wanted Bern to disappear.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]That's what I kept telling myself.[A]
..Anger motivates better
than sorrow...[A]
Anger has kept me alive...[A]
So that I can protect the
children...[A][Clear]
...Sigh...[A]
So...for now, at least until
the war ends...[A]
I have to stay angry at Bern.[A][Clear]
...But you're on our side, right?
I don't have to hate you...[A]
Do I?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It would make me so happy if
you didn't hate me, Lugh.[A]
If you would let me, I'd even
like to be...your friend.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Madam Melady.[A]
[0465]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Li...lina.
Lilina.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This.[A]
I give you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh... What a pretty white flower.
Thank you, Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Th... Thank...?
What that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I not smart...
I not know many words...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...
I said "Thank you."[A]
It's an expression
of gratitude.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Grat...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um...[A]
When someone does something for you and
you feel happy, you say, "Thank you."[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank...you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right...
Thank you.[A]
[0466]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight]L-Lilina. Lilina.
Thank...you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, Gonzalez,
it's not for greetings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This, I give you.[A]
You pretty.
Flower pretty.[A]
Look good together...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you very much,
Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]This really is a
beautiful flower...[A]
They grow by Roy's
home, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Roy?
Who Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Roy is the leader of this army.[A]
He's not very strong, but...
he's very kind.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Lilina like Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...?[A]
Yes... Yes, I like
him very much.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...I leave.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?
Wait, Gonzalez...[A]
[0467]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait!
Gonzalez![A]
What's wrong?[A]
Why have you been
avoiding me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sh...shut up![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah![A]
[OpenMidRight]G-go away!
Go, go, go![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][ToggleMouthMove]Only hurt me if
I talk to you...[A]
I know...

We different.[A]
But...I never forget.
I human because of you...[A]
I never forget.[A][Clear]
...Thank you...[A][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLilina]...No.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Li...lina?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]"Thank you"...is something
you say when you're happy.[A]
You don't use it when...
you leave someone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...
You cry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're crying too...
Why are you crying?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I...I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzalez...
Don't leave me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me to go away...
Please...[A]
Stay with me...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Lilina...
I...I...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gonzalez...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Waaahhh...[A]
[0468]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...?[A]
Who's that I see sneaking by
without so much as a hello?[A]
Whoever it is, he seems to
have a death wish.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]O-oh!
H-hello there, Nana![A]
Fancy meeting you here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't give me that, boy![A]
You've been avoiding me,
haven't you?[A]
Are you shy, or just
stupid?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, Nana, you seem to
be keeping in good health...[A]
Not planning on dying anytime
soon, I hope?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Harumph![A]
If I dropped dead who would keep my
pathetically helpless grandson in line?[A]
So tell me. It was three years ago I
sent you out to study the darkness.[A]
I hope you have a good excuse for
using that putrid anima magic.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Actually, I became a mage.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I must finally be going deaf. I thought
I heard you say you became a mage.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, sorry, I'll say it
so you can hear.[A]
I![....] USE![....] ANIMA![....]
MAGIC![....] NOW![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You...you blundering
failure![A]
You dare show your face
in front of me?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Help!
Murderer![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Foolish boy...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, where are you going,
Nana?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I always get a migraine when
I talk to you.[A]
I never want to see you again.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I thought I was a dead man for sure.[A]
Either she's gotten soft with age,[A]
or she was dumbfounded at how
handsome I've become.[A]
Either way, lucky me![A]
[0469]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidLeft]Hugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nana![A][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...What are you doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Oh, I'm just
bracing myself.[A]
For when you blast me with
your magic and all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You really are a fool.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't say that!
Come on, I'm your only grandson![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, most unfortunate, that.[A]
But there's nothing to be done
about it now, I'm afraid.[A]
Anyway, I need something from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Give me back that Nosferatu tome I
lent you when I sent you out.[A]
You have no use for it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gulp...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You...do have it, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hugh, those tomes are hard
to find![A]
I sincerely hope you didn't
pawn it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait!
No, no, no![A]
I didn't sell it!
I gave it away![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?!
And that's any better?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, but listen![A]
I met this kid who was studying dark magic,
and I traveled with him for a while.[A]
The kid was an orphan, so I felt kinda
bad for him, I guess.[A]
Anyway, one morning when I woke up,
the kid was gone, and so was the tome![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you didn't give it away.
A child stole it from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose that's one
way of putting it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's the only way
of putting it![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
H-hey, Nana.[A]
I'll leave if your
head hurts again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes, please do.[A]
Your departed parents would never forgive
me for reducing their only son to ash.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-you're right!
Bye![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]He's just like his father
was at that age...[A]
He tries to be bad, but his
heart is too kind.[A]
Why couldn't he inherit his
talent for dark magic as well?[A]
[046A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nana![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Was my old man good at dark magic?
I don't really remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I really did try to study dark magic,
but I couldn't seem to pick it up at all.[A]
That kid I told you about was
doing great, though.[A]
I thought that maybe I don't have the
talent, so I switched to anima magic.[A]
But the thing is, how can I not have the
talent for it when I have your blood?[A]
That's why I wanna know if my old man
had the talent or not.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your father had more talent for dark
magic than you could ever hope for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
That makes no sense.[A]
...Wait! I get it!
Of course![A]
[OpenMidLeft]An epiphany?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes! You're not really my
grandmother, are you?![A]
O-ow! What did you do
that for?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your stupidity. I'm your
grandmother, like it or not.[A]
You would never have been born
were it not for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's impossible![A]
This handsome face couldn't have
come from those hideous wrinkles.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was a stunning beauty when I was
your age.[A]
I would court men like you and drop them
once I'd milked all the money out of them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ouch...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your kindness comes from your father,[A]
and your talent for anima magic
comes from your mother.[A]
Your stupidity... That's probably
from your grandfather.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
My mom wasn't a shaman?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was determined at first to make my son's
wife a shaman.[A]
But your mother was a fine young lady with a
distinct talent for anima magic, so I caved...[A]
[ToggleSmile]...I was so proud of them both...
And yet they died so young...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry that all you have left is
a pathetic failure of a grandson.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Don't be.[A]
How I missed yelling at you
while you were gone.[A]
Perhaps misbehaving children really
are the most precious after all.[A]
All I want for you is to live a
long and fulfilling life, Hugh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Nana.[A]
[046B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There you are![A]
I never thought I'd
see you here.[A]
I've been looking
for you![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well, I sure wasn't
looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You took advantage of my
kindness...[A]
Brats like you are why
I hate kids.[A]
Now give me back my
Nosferatu tome.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes.
That thing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You haven't used it up
already, have you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]...Hey...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Calm down, I've got it.
I was just borrowing it.[A]
I was planning to give
it back some day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Y-you little thief...[A]
I lent it to you because you
said you wanted to see it.[A]
I didn't expect you to run
off with it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, like I said, I'm
borrowing it, not stealing it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then when are you
going to return it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's see...[A]
I suppose I could give it
back after I use it 20 times.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You better keep your word![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh well, I guess I
just gotta be patient...[A]
Hey, wait a minute![A]
It'll be all used up
after 20 times![A]
[046C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not letting you go this time!
Give me back that Nosferatu tome now![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Sorry, but I can't.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why not?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're a mage.[A]
What's the point in you having
a Nosferatu tome anyway?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ergh...
That's not the point...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This powerful tome would be a
waste in your hands.[A]
It would be your fault if we
lost the battle without it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er...[A]
F-fine, I'll let you have
it for now.[A]
But I want it back with
interest, you hear?![A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Heh, what an idiot.
So gullible.[A]
I can't even comprehend
such bumbling foolery.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Uh-oh...[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]You little...!
Give it back to me now![A]
[046D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRaigh][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?
What's this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll give you that gem.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Where did you get this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's none of your
business.[A]
It's a fair trade for
the spell tome.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nope.
I can't accept this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why not?[A]
You can sell the gem to buy
another Nosferatu tome.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This isn't about money.
It's about pride.[A]
...Let's see...
I want to hear an apology.[A]
Then you can have the
spell tome for free.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hah...[A]
How can someone be so stubborn
about something so stupid?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, look at you.[A]
All you have to do is
say you're sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't do it.[A]
I've paid you back with
the gemstone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I'm not taking it.[A]
You owe me until you
apologize![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hmph...
Adults.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Hmph...

[046E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHugh]One, two, three...[A]
Yup, that's all of it.[A]
Looks like I can trust Roy
to give me a steady paycheck.[A]
Time to show my worth...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh-what the--?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where'd you get all that money?
Are you a thief, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do I look like a thief to you?[A]
This is what they paid me
when I joined.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?!
That's not fair![A]
I've been working for
nothing all this time![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess you're not good
enough to get paid.[A]
You've got to show your worth
if you want cash.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Hmm...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Sounds like a challenge![A]
I'll show you how great
of a thief I am.[A]
I'll steal that money from
right under your nose![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, what?![A]
Fine!
Let's see you try![A]
[046F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Hugh![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]What are you getting all
nervous about?[A]
I'm just trying to be friendly here.[A]
Do you really think I'd try to
rob you in a place like this?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't trust you![A]
I'm gonna be on my guard
whenever you're around.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hah, you're so petty.[A]
You're getting all worked up
over a couple thousand gold?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-well, it's my money![A]
[OpenMidLeft]OK, I guess there's no getting past
you when you're super alert like that.[A]
You win for now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Good!
Give it up and go![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right.
But remember, Hugh![A]
I'll be back![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidRight][LoadHugh][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You again?![A]
Get away from me.
I'm not giving you my money.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Are you still on about that?
Talk about obsessive![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then stop trying to take it![A]
I mean, you're a thief.[A]
Don't you already have
bags of money somewhere?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No.[A]
Why would I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, right![A]
I see you running around
looting chests all the time![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I give it all to the poor.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm the Master Thief.
I have my dignity.[A]
I never keep a single coin
of the money I steal.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then...are you going to give my
money to the poor as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Then hey...[A]
You can have maybe a hundred...[A]
No...[A]
I can give you around half
of this money...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A]
I'm the Master Thief.
I have my dignity.[A]
I don't take charity.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I'm giving it to you.
Just take it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I said no.
I don't want it.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Besides...[A][Clear]
I've already
got your money.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?![A]

When did you switch my...?[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][A]

[0471]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you use dark magic.[A]
Although you appear to
be a beginner.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Look, old lady.
I'm busy.[A]
I don't have time for
geriatrics like you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come now, there's no need
to be so impatient.[A]
Studying by yourself won't
get you anywhere, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]?![A][ToggleMouthMove]
How did you know I
study on my own...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I haven't lived this
long for nothing, boy.[A]
I know the darkness much
better than you do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Who...[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My name is Niime.[A]
Remember it...[A]
[0472]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][OpenMidLeft]Ah, it's that impetuous

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]You... You're the Mountain Hermit.[A]
The master of darkness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm more famous than I realized.
What do you want?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
...I...I want you to
teach me dark magic.[A][Clear]
Teach me everything![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Is that how you ask
for a favor, boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I can change my tone if
it's not to your liking.[A]
If you want me to grovel,
I will.[A]
Just please, teach me
your dark magic![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]You're amusing...[A]
...All right, try
reading this to start.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What...is this...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You don't know?[A]
It's archaic writing used
in the oldest spell tomes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What...?[A]
The ancient scrolls I know
aren't written like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can you understand now
how deep dark magic is?[A]
You can have that.
Good luck reading it.[A][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph...[A]
Piece of cake...[A]
[0473]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][OpenMidLeft]Well?
How are your studies going?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
Don't even have the time
to talk, do you?[A]
You're a rude one, and you
lack respect for your elders.[A]
But you do seem to be serious
about learning dark magic.[A]
Why do you seek the power
of darkness, boy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I don't have any grandiose
reason or anything.[A]
I use dark magic for my own
purposes.[A]
I want to protect those I hold dear
and destroy all who oppose me.[A]
That's the power I seek.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This power...
It's not to be taken lightly.[A]
It can turn the whole planet
upside down if used incorrectly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh... So?[A]
I don't mind blowing up a
planet or two if I have to.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Good.[A]
Well said, lad.[A]
Now come... Come into the
depths of darkness...[A][Clear]
You can start by mastering
that book I gave you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
...ank you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm?
What was that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Nothing.[A]
[0474]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
Hello...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So you're the shaman
of Nabata?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes...[A]
My name...is Sophia...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A shy one, are we?[A]
I suppose you would be after spending
your whole life in that place...[A]
You remind me of me when I was
your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My name is Niime.[A]
I want to know more about
your village in Nabata.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]About the village...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right.[A]
But before that...
Are you human? Or dragon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]I am human...[A]
At least...
my father was human...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
Sorry to be so intrusive.
Don't worry about it.[A]
[0475]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Arcadia...lies within the
sandstorms of the desert...[A]
There aren't many pure dragons...[A]
But there are many people...with
dragon blood...in their veins...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know that you're a shaman,
but what exactly do you do?[A]
Rain dances and the like?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...can see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can see?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes... I can sometimes see...
the future...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Really?[A]
Is that because of the
dragon blood in you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I...don't know...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm...[A]
Don't let anyone know about
that power of yours.[A]
It could be dangerous for
our enemies.[A]
Even just the next day's
weather could decide a battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Not all outsiders are nice
people.[A]
I heard you were held captive
by Bern.[A]
I'm sure you don't want to go
through that again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I don't...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Don't worry.[A]
Roy would never think of
doing that to you.[A]
You're safe here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I feel that way...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNiime][OpenMidRight][LoadSophia][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What are dragons, anyway?
Where do they come from?[A]
What are they here for?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know...[A]
I don't know...
anything specific...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... Interesting.[A]
You don't know anything about the dragons
despite having their blood in your veins.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]If you were a normal girl, you
could lead an ordinary life,[A]
not having to worry about people
hunting you down for your power...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]I...I'm happy with myself...[A]
Even the dragon blood that flows
within me... It makes me who I am...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes... You're right.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You've a strong will.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me...? Strong...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're strong.[A]
You really are just like me
when I was your age.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D...do you really
think so...?[A]
[0477]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you there![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Hey! Are you deaf or are
you just ignoring me?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Uh...
...Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is there anyone else here?
You're a real idiot, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Anyway, I heard you
use elder magic.[A]
Is that true?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Let me see that spell tome.
I've never see--[A][MoveMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Ouch![A][Clear]
What the...?!
Did you just hit me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't...touch me...
please...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You've got guts,
I'll give you that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Whatever. You win.[A]
But you better show me that
spell tome next time![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Whoa!
Y-you again?![A]
I didn't even notice you...[A]
S-so what do you want?!
Come to hit me again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Here...[A]
[OpenMidRight]This dark tome![A]
Some say it exists
only in legend...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Yes...
...You're well-learned...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I am![A]
I've been searching
for this for so long![A]
[ToggleSmile]So this is it...[A]
Wow...I can feel
its power...![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Do you want it...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can have it?!
Are...are you sure?[A]
Can't you use it?
Why give it to me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, wait! Hey![A]
[0479]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRaigh][OpenMidLeft][LoadSophia][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you over there! You![A]
With the long hair dragging
on the ground![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I'm giving this tome
back to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...What?
...Why...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't want charity.
I'm not a beggar.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Even so...I want
you...to have it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?
Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Because...you are
a good person...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always act tough...[A]
...But...you have a kind heart...
so...you deserve it...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have a kind heart?![A]
You're the first person other than
my brother I've heard say that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I know you...better than
you know yourself...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Don't talk like that.
It's creepy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Well, it doesn't
bother me, though.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Thank you...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...What's your name?
I'm Raigh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Raigh...[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Larum.
What do you need?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's happening with
the plan?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You know, the plan to
build that village.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that plan.[A]
I've been recruiting
a lot of help.[A]
Do you want to
help out, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
What do you need
me to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Dance, of course.[A]
Your dancing cheers everyone up.[A]
It makes people want to get up
and get back to work.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[A]
Hmm...
I can cook, too.[A]
You know my special
protein--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ever since I founded the resistance,
I've been eating your...[A]
Well, I don't know what it is, but
it's certainly not "food".[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, I never!
I always work so hard on it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, Larum.[A]
Good cooks don't burn the house
down when making a proper meal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It wasn't a big loss
considering how tasty it was.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The wails and moans of the
resistance soldiers...[A]
I can still hear them
echoing in my ears.[A]
Has Elffin ever eaten it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, and he didn't even cry.
Or say anything, for that matter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]See?[A]
Everyone else just has something
wrong with their taste buds.[A]
My food was probably too
high-class for them.[A]
Actually...Lord Roy would
appreciate my culinary skills.[A]
Yes! I'm sorry, Echidna, but
I'm going to prove you wrong.[A]
I'll make Lord Roy try
my cooking![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...May Lord Roy rest in peace...[A]
[047B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight]Oh, Echidna.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Larum. Hey...[A]
You said you were going to
give that stuff to Roy, but...[A]
Did you actually do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?!
He praised me![A]
He said that it was really...[A]
Uh... That it looked really good.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So he ate it, huh?[A]
[ToggleSmile]When's the funeral?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmph![A]
I just wasn't doing too well
that day![A]
My father always says
my cooking is delicious.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't feel bad.[A]
Even if your cooking stinks, your
dancing is still the best around.[A]
I wish I could do what you do.
Make people enjoy life, I mean.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You know, you're
really selfless.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]W-what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're always thinking about others.[A]
You're even building a village so
that people can live in peace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're like one of those heroes
in a bard's epic![A]
You appear, help the needy, and
leave as suddenly as you came...[A]
You're mysterious too since you
never talk about yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah... I don't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I won't pry.[A]
I am curious, but I'm sure there's a
good reason you don't talk about it.[A]
[047C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight]Hey, Echidna![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just had a really
great idea![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you want to hear it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you sure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'm positive.
Come on. Let's hear it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]OK.[A]
I was thinking, when the village
is done, let's make a statue.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind of statue?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A statue of you![A]
It can have an engraving that says,
"Here lies a great hero..."[A]
Or something like that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hold on there.
I don't plan on dying yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway, it's your village, so there
has to be a statue of you somewhere.[A]
Try to come up with a good pose
for it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]She's an odd girl...[A]
But I guess I knew
that already.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadLarum]Oh, one more thing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you go disappearing on us!
We all love you.[A]
Don't you dare try and run off![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah... I won't, Larum.[A]
[047D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek!
A pirate![A]
[OpenMidRight]W-wait a minute![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Eeeeeeeek![A][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Help me, help me, help me![A]
[OpenMidRight]S-stop...
Wait![A]
Listen to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Why should I?
Pirates are all the same.[A]
You're just going to say, "Shut up!"[A]
Or, "You'd better keep quiet if you
want to live!" Or something like that.[A]
Oh no!
I'm looking death in the face![A]
But just you wait.[A]
Soon Lord Roy'll come to my rescue
on a shining white stallion...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Uh, are you done?[A]
Listen.
I'm not a pirate anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph![A]
I know better than to listen to
your honeyed words![A]
I know you just want to kidnap
me because I'm so irresistible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Not a chance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?! Are you saying I'm
not cute enough to kidnap?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, you...[A]
No... Forget it.
See you around. Or not.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait![A]
[047E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft]Eeeeeeek!
It's the pirate again![A]
[OpenMidRight]I said I'm not...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're still trying to cover up
the obvious truth?[A]
Your hairstyle, your clothes...[A]
Everything about you just screams,
"Yo ho ho, I'm a pirate!"[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Fine...
Have it your way.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aha!
You admit it![A]
So? What's next?[A]
You still want to
kidnap me, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Seriously...[A]
Just listen to what
I have to say...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh no!
I'm looking death in the face![A]
But just you wait.[A][Clear]
Lord Roy could beat you down
any day of the week![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadLarum]
[ToggleSmile]"Are you hurt, Larum?"[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadLarum][ToggleSmile]"Oh, Lord Roy..."[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadLarum][ToggleSmile]"Larum, I can't live
without you."[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadLarum][ToggleSmile]"Oh, me neither, milord..."[A][Clear]
And then he moves in close
and... [MoveLeft]Ooooohhhh![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hey, where are
you going?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Away...[A]
Talking with you
is exhausting.[A]
[047F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarum][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the pirate![A]
Are you still
trying to--[A]
[OpenMidRight]This is yours, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh...[A]
I lost this ribbon
the other day. Wait![A]
I get it.[A]
You stole it, right?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Why would I return it if I
stole it?![A]
I found it lying on the ground
and I thought it might be yours.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh.[A]
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I would have if you let me![A]
You just started screaming
whenever we met![A]
You should stop and
listen once in a while...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're not a bad guy then.[A]
I had nothing to be scared
of all along.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hold on there, buster.[A]
I'll show you a special dance
in return.[A]
Hey, I said wait...[A]
What?![A]
Are you saying you don't
want to see my dance?![A]
[0480]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Juno...
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh?[A]
Are you looking out
for me, Thea?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, you've been retired
for a while now...[A]
I'm sure you're not too rusty,
but anything can happen.[A]
I was a little worried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks... But I'm fine.[A]
How about you?[A]
How is it leading a squad of
pegasus knights?[A]
I know you're responsible, but
did you get along with your squad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think I was
anything special...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I probably did
all right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure you did fine, Thea.[A]
Good job...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]J-Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
You don't like having
your head pet anymore?[A]
You used to love it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Th-that was a long time ago...
I'm not...a kid anymore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you don't like it
anymore?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not that I don't
like it, but...you know...[A]
[0481]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Juno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thea?
What's the matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing.[A]
I was just wondering whether
you're all right...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, Thea, before you go,
let's chat a little.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um...but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's OK, Thea.[A]
You can still act like a little
sister when we're alone together.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]You're strong,
but I know you get lonely...[A][Clear]
Do you remember the time I first
left for pegasus knight training?[A]
You thought I was leaving
forever, and you--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]D-don't bring that up...![A]
I was still a little girl...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was glad you cared so much
about me, Thea.[A]
You were always so blunt, so I
sometimes thought you didn't like me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's silly...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But...you cried so much when I left.
"Don't leave us, Juno!"[A]
I almost cried myself.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Juno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thea, if you ever feel
down, come talk to me.[A]
Because...I'll always be
your big sister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah...[A]
[0482]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadThea][OpenMidRight]Juno?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I was thinking...[A]
Maybe you should leave the rest of
the battle to us and rest a bit.[A]
I know you're a mother now, so...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh? Are you saying
I've lost my edge?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]N-no, that's not what I mean.
I just...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, Thea. Thank you.[A]
But I'm fine. I am still a
pegasus knight of Ilia.[A]
I'm the one who taught you how to
ride a pegasus in the first place.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I know, but...[A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
If anything happens...[A]
I'll be here for you,
Juno.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know...
Thank you, Thea.[A]
[0483]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]It's Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shanna.
Have you been well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah!
Really well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's already been a year since
you left for training...[A]
Are you getting along with
the other mercenaries?[A]
I heard they were all men.
Are you doing all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I'm doing fine!
They're all really nice.[A]
And I'm doing really well
in battle, too![A]
I do all the work,
actually.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah![A]
After we joined Lord Roy, the
enemies started getting stronger...[A]
But still I beat all of them
single-handed![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow... That's amazing.[A]
You've been working hard,
Shanna...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tee hee...[A]
[0484]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it,
Shanna?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Teach me how to ride a
pegasus like you.[A]
The way you fly is really neat.
I wish I could fly like that...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'd like to, but not now.
We're in a battle.[A]
I can teach you when we
have some free time...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Oh.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Then let's practice
our special move![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Special move...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Triangle Attack![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that move mother used
to tell us about...[A]
[ToggleSmile]But we need Thea to do
the Triangle Attack.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... Right.
[ToggleSmile]Then, um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the matter,
Shanna?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We haven't seen each
other for so long.[A]
I just don't want us to
be separated again...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...You always used to cling to me
like that when you were little.[A]
Shanna, be a good girl and wait
until the war is over.[A]
Then we can spend as much time
together as we like...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... You're right.
OK![A]
[0485]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna]
[OpenMidRight]Juno![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shanna, I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]While you were away,
we had a baby girl.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?! You had a baby
with Zelot?![A]
Where, where?!
I want to hold her...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't bring a baby to the
battlefield, Shanna.[A]
She's with a friend back home.
You can see her when we go back.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh boy! Juno's baby...
I bet she's super cute![A]
I really want to see her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry.
You will.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But wait a second...
My sister had a baby?[A]
That makes me...an aunt?
I'm too young to be an aunt![A]
[0486]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Juno, er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?
What is it, Zelot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Our daughter...
Is she all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm sure she is.[A]
I've entrusted her to
a close friend.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh. Good...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just...
What's she like?[A]
Does she look like you?
Does she have my nose?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you haven't seen her yet,
have you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I've been out working.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's go see her together
when the war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes... I would like that.[A]
[0487]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Juno, I've been thinking...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't think it's good to leave
our newborn baby with someone else.[A]
You should go back home so you can
take care of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's all right.[A]
I trust my friend to take
excellent care of her.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But she needs her
mother's love.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I fight precisely because
I'm her mother.[A]
I want her to grow up
without war and conflict.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I think I've told you before,[A]
but nowhere is safe until
this war ends.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's certainly true...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So I think we should focus all
our effort on ending this war.[A]
Can you accept that, Zelot?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
[0488]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft]You're coming back to Edessa
once the war ends, aren't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will you stay with
us after that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't think that's possible...[A]
I'll need to lead the mercenary knights
to more work opportunities as before.[A]
We can't support ourselves otherwise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But most of Ilia's land can
grow food now.[A]
With enough effort, we can
produce enough food to get by...[A]
[OpenMidRight]That won't happen overnight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know, but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Besides, who can guarantee a good
harvest every single year?[A]
Were our crops to fail, how would
we get money?[A]
How would we survive the winter if
we're not prepared for failure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]I must lead the mercenary knights to
make money,[A]
at least until we can support ourselves
even after a bad harvest.[A]
I'll leave Edessa to you, so keep doing
what you can to cultivate the land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I will...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have faith that there will come a time
when Ilia will be self-sufficient.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think so, too.[A]
I know that someday you won't have
to leave us anymore.[A]
That we'll finally be together as
a family.[A]
[0489]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJuno]Trec?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh... He was here just
a minute ago...[A]
Hm?[A]
What's this paper...?
Did he drop it?[A]
It has a lot of
writing on it...[A]
Let's see...[A]
"I was a horse."[A]
"I tried running."[A]
"I got tired."[A]
...What is this?[A]
[048A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight]Oh, Trec.
I was looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, hullo,
Lady Juno.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You look as sleepy as always.[A]
Oh, right... Here.[A]
Is this yours?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Ah...
Yeah, it's mine.[A]
I lost it the
other day.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought so.[A]
I'm sorry, but I read a
little bit of it...[A]
What are you writing
about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I write down the
dreams I have.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Dreams?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. When I look at what
I wrote,[A]
I remember all the kinds of
dreams I've had.[A]
It helps me sleep better.[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I see.
That sounds interesting...[A]
Maybe I should try it, too.[A]
[048B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadJuno]
[OpenMidRight]Trec?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Can you show me that paper
with your dreams on it?[A]
I'm very interested in it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uhm... Sure.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][Clear]
"I was praised by Commander Zelot."[A]
He shows up in your dreams, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, sometimes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's see...[A]
"The war ended."[A]
"There was peace."[A]
"Spring came to Ilia."[A]
"Everyone slept happily
ever after..."[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Is something wrong,
Lady Juno?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...No, I'm sorry.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Can you show me your dreams
again sometime, Trec?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well...[A]
It's a little embarrassing,
to tell the truth.[A]
But OK, you can see them.[A]
I'll sleep as much as I can and
show you all the latest ones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Trec.[A]
[048C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hello, Lady Juno.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're worried about me?[A]
That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...I'm not that antisocial,
Lady Juno...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was just kidding.[A]
You seem uncaring, but I know
you have a kind heart.[A]
Are you holding up OK?[A]
You've gone through many
battles to make it here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.[A]
Commander Zelot
helped us greatly.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It's thanks to him I'm
still alive now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see...[A]
He always works himself
too hard in battle...[A]
[048D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sigune...
She turned to Bern.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, she ambushed us in the blizzard
with her pegasus knights.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[A]
Sigune and I used to be
rivals, you know.[A]
We were always competing
against each other.[A]
It all seems so...distant
when I think about it now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Sigune always tried to act tough, but
she was a kindhearted person inside.[A]
I just wish it hadn't come to this...[A]
War creates so much pain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yes.
But that's war.[A]
[048E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuno][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Noah.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem to avoid developing
close relationships.[A]
Is it because you don't want
to suffer from loss?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I don't know.[A]
It's just easier to avoid getting
close with anyone.[A]
The tighter the bond, the greater your
suffering when that bond is broken.[A]
...I think you know that better
than any of us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
Perhaps in Ilia it's better
to live the way you do.[A]
But someday you'll realize
relationships aren't so bad.[A]
Maybe all you need is to
fall in love.[A]
[048F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Hey! Sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Shanna, this is a
battlefield.[A]
What if an archer heard
you screaming like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.
No archer can hit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Sigh...[A]
...Shanna, where are your reins?[A]
You could fall off your
pegasus without them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I took them off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You took them off?[A]
Shanna, you never know
what can happen.[A]
So considering all the
possibilities, I think...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You worry too much, Thea![A]
Flying is more fun without
all the extra gear.[A][Clear]
See ya![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shanna, wait!
I'm not finished yet...[A][Clear]
...Sigh.[A]
[0490]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thea... You're starting
to get annoying...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I worry for your sake.[A]
If you won't listen to
your big sister,[A]
I won't let you ride that
pegasus anymore.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What?!
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shanna, you brought this
upon yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're always like that![A]
Always saying everything's
my fault...[A]
You could say it...
a little nicer...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't!
If I did, you wouldn't--[A]
[OpenMidRight]No!
I hate you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Shanna...
Um...[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-what the--?!
What are you doing?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Juno...used to pet our heads
like this, didn't she?[A]
I'm your big sister, too...[A]
So I thought I should try
to make you feel better...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Shanna, I'm sorry...[A]
I don't know how to be
kind like Juno...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thea...[A]
...Did you take a hit to
the head or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Why, you...[A]
Fine, I don't care anymore.[A]
You can fend for yourself
from now on![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, wait! Sorry![A]
It just slipped out...[A]
[0491]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight]Hey! Thea![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry about before.[A]
But I was really happy that
you care so much.[A]
I love you, Sister![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]...How can you say that without
turning red...?[A]
I envy you sometimes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about you?
Do you love me, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...There's no need to say
it out loud...[A]
[OpenMidRight]You...don't love me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's just that...[A]
We don't have to say it here,
in the middle of...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh... I...
I never knew.[A]
Thea... You never
loved me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right, all right!
I love you![A]
[ToggleSmile]Of course I love you.
You're my only little sister.[A]
I'll...I'll always care
for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Tee hee... Thanks!
See you![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Why, you...[A]
[0492]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot, I'm sure you're
aware, but my mission is complete.[A]
Regardless, I wish to remain with
this army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well.[A]
You know, fate works in
strange ways.[A]
We were hired by the Lycian Army,
and you were hired by Etruria...[A]
I never thought we would be
fighting together.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is strange indeed.[A]
Etruria didn't seem to view us highly,
but Commander Klein was caring.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The important thing is
that you're safe...[A]
Juno was pretty worried about
you and Shanna, you know.[A]
Knowing you, I knew you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Juno.
She's a worrier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I know that all
too well.[A]
Juno often spoiled
Shanna and me.[A]
The day we left was a
hectic one indeed.[A]
Juno fretted over us
so much.[A]
Over our meals, and
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, that's Juno.[A]
[0493]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I was wondering...[A]
Juno's... Your parents...
What were they like?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Juno never told you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No. All I know is that
they were soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, our mother was a pegasus knight.[A]
Our parents were killed together on the
battlefield when we were young.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]We had no other relatives to
turn to...[A]
So Juno became our mother when
she was still a teenager...[A]
[OpenMidRight]It must have been difficult.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ordinary girls her age concern
themselves with romance,[A]
but Juno took on the role of
mother.[A]
She never complained, though...[A]
She always looked after us...
with a smile on her face.[A]
That's why...[A]
That's why I always wanted
Juno to find happiness.[A]
[0494]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThea][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot]
[OpenMidRight]...I have to thank you for
helping us with the wedding.[A]
You set up the location and
made a wonderful feast...[A]
Oh, and Juno was very pleased with
the gift from you and Shanna.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really...?[A]
I actually didn't want
to give it...[A]
But Shanna never listens
once she's made up her mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha...
It was an interesting gift.[A]
But...I want to apologize to Juno.[A]
If only I...[A]
If only our nation had more
to give,[A]
she could have had a proper,
elegant wedding...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I doubt Juno feels that
way at all.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm very grateful to you,
Commander Zelot.[A]
Your wedding...[A]
I'd never seen Juno
look happier.[A]
I thank you for all
you've done for her.[A]
[0495]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft]Zelot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Shanna.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Zelot...[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, hey, you're my brother now
since you're Juno's husband...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you may call me
"Brother" if you wish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
I wanted to ask you
something.[A]
How did you meet Juno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...
Perhaps some other time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why not now?[A]
Don't be mean.
Come on, tell me![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not my intention to be mean...[A]
You'll understand when you're older,[A]
but that's not a question you
should ask another...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But I really want to know...[A]
I think I have a right to
know as your sister...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zelot?
Wait![A]
[0496]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot][OpenMidLeft]Zelot![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...You won't let me go,
will you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're family.
I want to know everything...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...[A]
Very well, I suppose...[A]
...We first met in battle
in Etruria.[A]
Juno's pegasus squad was
hired by our enemy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whoa...[A]
[OpenMidRight]We decided to settle the dispute
peacefully through diplomacy.[A]
Juno was a beautiful and caring
woman, so things went well.[A]
We got to know each other,
and it progressed after that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What did you say
when you proposed?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-you want to know
that, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
We're family...aren't we?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So did you propose?
Or was it Juno?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
[0497]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShanna][OpenMidRight][LoadZelot]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad you're
a good guy.[A]
You and Juno look
perfect together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A]
I'm relieved you
don't hate me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why would I hate you?
You're strong, you're kind...[A]
And Juno loves you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]By the way...tell me
about yourself.[A]
Are there any men you
have in mind?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sorry, that's a secret![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-what?[A]
After making me tell you so much,
you won't do the same for me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're family.[A]
Family have to keep
secrets from each other![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-wait, Shanna...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]See ya![A]
[0498]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][.....][OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]Blast...![A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm sorry, Melady.[A]
I was too focused on the
enemies in front of me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry about it.[A]
Galle often looked out for me
like this, too.[A]
If we can survive by helping each
other out, then that's fine by me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I need to learn to
defend myself on my own...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're still inexperienced.[A]
It's all right. I'll watch your
back until you're strong enough.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Thanks.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidRight]But no... I can't accept that.[A]
I must become strong enough
to protect her, too...![A]
[0499]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zeiss!
Slow down![A]
You have to be
more careful![A]
[OpenMidRight]I got him![A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Don't rush like that![A]
You were lucky you
defeated him...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, well... The point
is I beat him.[A]
It's all right, Melady.
I was fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But who can say that you'll
be so lucky next time?![A]
[OpenMidRight]...It wasn't luck.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss...[A]
Just listen to your older sister.[A]
I would never be able to forgive myself
if I let something happen to you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You don't trust me,
do you?[A]
Am I so weak that you
can't even rely on me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss, I'm not saying that.[A]
Stop being a child.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then...stop treating
me like one![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A][Clear]
...Why...?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][LoadZeiss]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
What were you thinking, taking
a blow for me like that?![A]
[OpenMidRight]...Even you forget to pay attention
to the enemies around you sometimes.[A]
Are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm fine... What about you, Zeiss?
Aren't you hurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's just a scratch.
Melady, your arm is bleeding...[A]
Hang on, I'll go get
some vulneraries...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Zeiss![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Thanks for saving me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't need to thank me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Little Zeiss, coming to my rescue?[A]
He's matured so quickly...[A]
It's no wonder he got angry when
I treated him like a child.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Your Highness!
You're alive?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...You must have me mistaken
for someone else.[A]
I am Elffin...
A simple bard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you...![A]
No, it can't be...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nothing...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then I shall be off.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Can I help you,
General Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Have you ever been
to Etruria?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not yet...[A]
I traveled through the Western Isles
before I joined this army.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then do you know of the
three Etrurian Generals?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Yes, I do.[A]
There is you, the Mage General,[A]
and then there are the Knight
General and the Great General.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are very knowledgeable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is my job as a bard
to know such things.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]You insist on continuing
this farce, don't you?[A]
Then I have an idea.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Show me your right shoulder that you
are conveniently hiding with your hair.[A][ToggleSmile]
If you are but a simple bard as
you say,[A]
then there won't be a scar from
a magic attack.[A]
May I have a look...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Persistent, aren't you, Cecilia?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is you, Prince Myrddin![A]
What happened?[A]
Why did you not tell me that
you were alive?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...I did not want you
caught up in this.[A]
But now it seems you're
involved as well.[A]
[049D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElffin][OpenMidRight][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cecilia...[A]
How much longer are you
going to stay mad?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I understand why you were hiding
your identity from me, my prince.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Cecilia.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
But Your Highness, you told
General Douglas.[A]
Did you lack trust in me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not why...[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll let it go for now,
Your Highness.[A]
Though I expect an explanation
after the war is over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...As intimidating as always.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In this situation, yes.[A]
You have brought grief not just
to me, but to your people as well.[A]
Please show our people that you
live, Your Highness.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...
I will, Cecilia.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're a

[OpenMidRight]Uh, yeah... I guess.[A]
[ToggleSmile]That was your first
thought, huh? Man...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I used to be a seafaring

[OpenMidLeft]Really? You must've made a lot
of money, then. Lucky you.[A]
Us poor folk gotta keep breaking
our backs, I guess... See ya.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's my bag doing
in your hand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
S-some eye you've got.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gee, thanks.
Now give it back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine...[A]
But there's no treasure I
can't steal![A]
Be on your guard, for you
never know when I'll strike![A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]I'm madly in love with you!
Please hold me...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Hey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh, yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Were you hit with a berserk
staff or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're a lousy actor.
Why are you even trying?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
You saw through my seduction skills?!
I should have given you more credit![A]
[OpenMidRight]Gee, thanks.[A]
But I'm not really the lovey-dovey
type. That won't work on me.[A]
You'll need to think of another
way to rob me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I-I knew that!
This was just a test![A]
[ToggleSmile]But next time's for real.
You won't know what hit ya![A]
Your stuff is mine![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sure it is.
Good luck with that.[A]
[04A0]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidLeft][LoadCath][OpenMidLeft]Geese![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Does this look familiar?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, that's my...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh![A]
Guess you weren't so
good after all![A]
There's no treasure
I can't steal![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sigh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, let's see now.
What have we got in here?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]............
............[A][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]
What...what the
heck is this?![A]
It's nothing but
worthless junk![A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not junk.
Maps, compasses...[A]
It's sailing
equipment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But what about treasure?!
Where's your treasure?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha, I never had
any treasure![A]
I'm broke.[A]
Drowning in debt,
to tell the truth.[A]
I've got nothing
worth stealing![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Grr... Wipe that smile 
off your face![A]
Being broke is nothing
to be proud of![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's OK. I've got a dream.[A]
I'm gonna go back to being a trader
and hit the jackpot. You'll see.[A]
My ship'll be so full of riches
it'll barely stay afloat.[A]
Maybe then you'll have something
to steal![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Did...did I lose?
Are you a big shot?[A]
...Or just an idiot?[A]
[04A1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You must be one of Ilia's

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How...how do you feel about fighting
alongside a knight from Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
Whatever.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wh...whatever?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not like people from Bern
have seven ears or anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
Well, no, I have only two.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Exactly.[A]
We're all brothers
and sisters.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do...you think so?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[A]
[04A2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft]Ahh...

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is something wrong,

[OpenMidRight]Melady.[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well...[A]
I was just sitting here
watching you fight.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were watching me fight?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah...
My neck hurts now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah. And the way you fight
made me think...[A]
Do you have any loved
ones in Bern?[A]
Like family or a lover
or something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...N-no, I'm all alone.
I live for Princess Guinivere...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, OK.
Yeah, that figures.[A]
I'm usually wrong.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh well, guess I hurt
my neck for nothing.[A]
[04A3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadMelady][OpenMidLeft]Oh, what's your
name again...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Melady.[A]
Do you always forget
people's names?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's my hobby.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]You are an odd individual,
Sir Trec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?[A]
I think I'm pretty normal.[A]
Everyone always tells me
I look so carefree.[A]
But I have concerns too,
you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh?
Like what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the other day
I dreamed I was a horse.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...A horse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I think this dream has some kind
of hidden meaning somewhere...[A]
It's been keeping me up for
some time now.[A]
It's gotten to the point that
I can only sleep at night.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Thank you,
Sir Trec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I feel a little better now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?
Why's that?[A]
[04A4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft]Whoa.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez? You're huge.
And look at your muscles.[A]
You must be able to pull trees
right out of the ground.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm, this is quite a find.[A]
There's no way that I'm
letting you get away.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...
What?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
...I get away now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, wait![A]
[04A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wait, don't leave!
I need a favor from you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I need you.[A]
I'm going to help build a new
village in the Western Isles.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Village...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There are lots of people who
lost their homes in the war.[A]
Even many people in the
resistance force are homeless now.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Lost their home...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm going to build a village
for those people.[A]
But I can't do it on my own.[A]
What I really need is big,
strong men like you.[A]
What do you say?
You'll get free meals.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But...I ugly...[A]
I not be with people.
People hate me...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, don't be ridiculous.[A]
Help them out by carrying a couple
logs and everyone'll love you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Love me...?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I help you.[A]
[04A6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidLeft]Hey again.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh...[A]
What...
What your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, right. I never
told you, did I?[A]
I'm--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No... I stupid.
I not remember...[A]
...And I ugly. Everyone stare
at me... I ugly and stupid...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh dear.
Gonzalez, all you need is confidence.[A]
Maybe you're not the most handsome guy,
and maybe you're no genius.[A]
But so what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, Gonzalez.
I'll be frank with you.[A]
You've got a good heart,
but you're ugly as sin.[A]
That's why people make
fun of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But that's no reason to
give up.[A][ToggleSmile]
Everyone has strong points
and weak points.[A]
Find something unique
to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Unique...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right. Unique to you.[A]
Once you do that, no one will
make fun of you anymore.[A]
You'll have no reason to think
so lowly of yourself.[A]
You can stand proud, with both
your strong points and weak points.[A]
[OpenMidRight]U...unique...?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I think later.[......]
My head hurt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha...
Take all the time you need.[A]
[04A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hngh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm...?
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me?
I...I Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Trec.
Nice to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]T...T...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Trec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trec, Trec, Trec, Trec, Tre...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, you don't need to
say it so many times.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Quiet.
I forget.[A]
...Cret, Cret, Cret...[.....]
OK, I remember.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, you're an odd one.
Say, do you think you--[A]
[ToggleSmile]Sorry, what was
your name again?[A]
[04A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh?[A]
You...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Who you?
I see you before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?
I must be famous.[A]
My name is Trec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tr...Tr...
Tr--[A]
[OpenMidRight]--rec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Rec.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep... So hey,
what's your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]R-really?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, it has kind of
a calm air to it...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Calm...[A]
What calm...?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm? ...Hmm...[A]
You know, I don't
really know either.[A]
But hey, don't worry
about it.[A]
It doesn't matter much
in the grand scheme.[A]
[04A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGonzalez][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahhh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's so peaceful here...[A]
I think we could make a
good team, you and me.[A]
Uh, but what's your...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gonzalez?
That's a nice name...[A]
Oh yeah, my name is...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You Rec.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm? Am I?[A]
Oh yeah, you're right. Rec.
That sounds like my name.[A]
Well, whatever.
Let's go.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ugh.[A]
[04AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot,
are you all right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
This is nothing.
We are knights of Ilia.[A]
We have more experience than
the knights of any other nation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but I still have
a lot to learn.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Humble. Good.[A]
...Oh.[A]
Noah, have you written
your letter yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Letter?
Oh... That letter.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Surely you remember what you
were told when you first enlisted.[A]
There are pegasus knight
messengers that fly with us.[A]
Should you fall in battle, they
will deliver our letters for us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I remember.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Neither of us will have
peaceful deaths.[A]
We need those letters.[A]
Noah, don't you have anyone
to send that letter to?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually...not really.[A]
I do recall the others
writing letters, though.[A]
They addressed them to
their parents...or lovers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You should do the same.[A]
Why don't you get a
girlfriend?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'll think about it.[A]
[04AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Commander Zelot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is this about the letter?[A]
Have you changed your mind?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I suppose even I have someone
I want to send a letter to when I die.[A]
It's you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Trec and I...
And Grant and Sieks...[A]
We've all made it this
far thanks to you.[A]
I want to express my
gratitude to you when I die.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Speaking of those two...
I wonder where they are now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've no idea.[A]
But I instructed them well.
They won't die so easily.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I heard that some people we used
to work with were hired by Bern...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes...[A]
But such is the life of a
mercenary.[A]
We give our blood and get
money in return.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Commander Zelot,
what do you think of that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nobles from other nations say
that Ilia sells death for a living.[A]
They say that we're vultures.
That we prey on blood and decaying flesh.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't bother me.[A]
We both know that Ilia couldn't
survive without war.[A]
We give our own blood to
survive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's true.[A]
[04AC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Commander Zelot?[A]
Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Noah.[A]
No... Nothing's wrong.
Did I seem troubled?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all.[A]
I just thought that something
might have happened.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...A letter arrived today.
It was your friend's...[A]
Grant's.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Would you like to read it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Not now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All right.
Then let's go.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[A]
[04AD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidLeft]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...Uh...[A]
Oh, Noah...
I didn't notice you there.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, I've been standing here for
a while now.[A]
I'm used to it, so I don't mind
you falling asleep every ten seconds.[A]
But you know, don't you have anything
else to do?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like practicing your
swings or something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well...
What about you?[A]
Have you been doing
anything like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me?
...Not really.[A]
...I guess I'm no
different from you.[A]
So, what did you do back
in Ilia during our vacation?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I slept.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I mean other than that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I didn't do...
Oh, actually, I went fishing.[A]
You know how the lakes freeze over in
the winter?[A]
You can punch a hole in the ice with your
lance and lower some string inside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds appropriate
for you.[A]
What did you catch?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nothing.[A]
I had plenty of fun just sitting there
staring into space holding the string.[A]
[OpenMidRight]...You really live life
to the fullest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what did you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]...Nothing, really.[A]
[04AE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah][OpenMidRight]Trec, do you remember Cassis?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Cassis?[A]
Hmm...[A]
Sounds familiar...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't remember him?[A]
He's the guy that forgot to bring
his weapons to our first mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, right![A]
I remember Commander Zelot yelled at
him even more than he yelled at me.[A]
He even forgot to bring his horse,
you know.[A]
He was fighting on foot![A]
I couldn't believe there was someone
dumber than me in our squad.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, he's dead now.[A]
He was hired by Bern...
He fell somewhere nearby.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Oh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mercenaries are in high demand
right now...[A]
We could have ended up fighting
him if we had been unlucky.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, well...[A]
[ToggleSmile]We're sellswords.
It happens.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I guess you're right...[A]
I envy that carefree personality
of yours sometimes...[A]
[04AF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][LoadNoah]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm?
Something wrong, Noah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No...[A]
I was just thinking
some things over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thinking things over?
Don't bother.[A]
Humans aren't meant to think
deeply like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Maybe.[A]
But you know, this war...[A]
I mean, I never wanted to go out
and save the world or anything,[A]
but look how many battles we've
been through.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But no matter what we've done,
Ilia's still the same.[A]
Our children, and our children's
children...[A]
They'll be peddling death to
make a living, just like we do.[A]
I was just wondering...
Can't we do anything about that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I wonder...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Maybe it's useless for us
to try and make a difference...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well... It doesn't really
matter, does it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I mean, everyone goes through hard times.
Isn't that just part of life?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Maybe so.[A]
Hey, Trec.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Take me along the next
time you go fishing.[A]
[04B0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trec.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Trec?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Oww![A]
Wh...what the?
Why does my head hurt?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because I just hit you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Commander Zelot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Trec, you were sleeping
on the job again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, you got me... Sorry, sir.
I couldn't help it...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You never fail, do you?[A]
You go right to sleep
at any chance.[A]
And what's more, you sleep
with your eyes open.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah... Thanks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've been meaning to say this for
a long time. You lack discipline.[A]
I'll be checking on you regularly
from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, sir...[A]
Yawn...[A]
[04B1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Trec...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Zzz...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]Owww![A]
[ToggleSmile]Uh... Commander Zelot?[A]
Yawn...
Good morning, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trec...[A]
There are rumors about you going
around.[A]
They say that the Ilian knight Trec
swings his sword in his sleep![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have yet to accomplish such
a feat, sir.[A]
...But that does sound pretty
cool.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Trec, you've got talent.
Why don't you do your job properly?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We are members of the proud
Ilian mercenary knights.[A]
This is a battle that will
determine the fate of the world...[A]
And there's even more.[A]
The reputation of the Ilian mercenary
knights will be affected by our actions.[A]
It all depends upon how we fight in
this battle.[A]
It could have repercussions on the
future of Ilia itself, and thus...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Zzz...[A]
[04B2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][OpenMidRight][LoadTrec][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Trec, are you awake?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You are?
That's a pleasant surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I have my moments, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That you do.[A]
Trec...
You've done well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We couldn't have come this far
without you.[A]
We all owe you our lives.[A]
You can sleep as much as you
like from now on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wow, thanks, sir...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZelot][ToggleSmile]...Trec![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadTrec]
[OpenMidLeft]Were you sleeping again?![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? What?
Commander Zelot?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How many times must
I tell you?[A]
You can't keep doing this...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Good morning to you,
too, sir.[A]
[04B3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You can sail a ship, right?
I want to ask a favor of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah. I'm planning on building a
new village in the Western Isles.[A]
What I want is for you to use
your ship to carry people there.[A]
I'll pay you well.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...My ship, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's the matter?
You can sail one, can't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]...Yeah, that's no problem.[A]
I was once the captain of a
trading vessel.[A]
There's no ocean I haven't
seen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]...Then why did you
become a pirate?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I couldn't continue my trading
business in this war.[A]
We had no choice, so my mates
and I turned to piracy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh.[A]
[OpenMidRight]But we were just seafarers
at heart.[A]
We didn't like fighting or
robbing or any of that stuff.[A]
But anyway, the first time
we set sail as pirates,[A]
everyone started complaining
of stomachaches and seasickness.[A]
They were all having second
thoughts about the whole thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No gut for piracy, eh?
I'm surprised you made it this far.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, well, I sure wasn't doing
it because I liked it...[A]
[04B4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We may have turned to piracy, but
we had no idea what we were doing.[A]
...We figured we'd go for easy
targets first.[A]
We picked a small trading ship
for our first one.[A]
We took over the ship without
much of a fight, but...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There were no valuables.[A]
The captain of the ship told me he
was in the same situation as us.[A]
He said that he was thinking of
resorting to piracy to get by, too...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What did you do?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We let them go.[A]
I couldn't rob them
after hearing that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A pirate with a heart of gold, eh?
I can't imagine you made a good living.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yeah, I doubted myself a lot
after that.[A]
But we kept with it and decided to
go after a bigger ship next.[A]
We figured we could steal from the
rich and keep a clean conscience.[A]
Not long after that, we were lucky
and came across a large trading ship.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We didn't have to hold back
this time.[A]
We charged the ship...[A]
But when we got close, ballistae and
archers flooded out from within.[A]
It was one of Bern's warships.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yikes.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]They fired at us mercilessly and
chased us for three days and nights.[A]
We got away somehow, but our ship
was wrecked.[A]
We hadn't made any money, either.
Some of the boys broke down and cried.[A]
Heck, even I felt like crying after
that disaster.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't blame you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, like I said, I wasn't
doing it because I liked it...[A]
[04B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEchidna][OpenMidRight][LoadGeese][OpenMidLeft]Hm?[A]
What's that?
A map?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's the one treasure I've
gotten as a pirate.[A]
I found it when we were
battling another pirate crew.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]See the skull mark here?[A]
It means buried treasure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you dug it up yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not yet.[A]
Once the war ends, I want to
be a merchant again,[A]
but I have no money to get
started.[A]
If this map is right,[A][ToggleSmile]
I can dig up the treasure
and repair my ship.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]I have no money left.[A]
I even went into debt to feed
my mates.[A]
If this map's a fake, then I'll
have to let go of my ship forever.[A]
...I can't help but feel a little
scared when I think of that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But no amount of worrying will
get you that treasure.[A]
You have to take action.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]...Yeah.
You're right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even if that map's a fake, there
are other treasures out there.[A]
Once you get your ship fixed up,[A]
you'll help us out by carrying the
residents to the new village, right?[A]
I'm counting on you.
Show me your ship sometime.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You got it.
I won't let you down.[A]
[04B6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidLeft]Lilina, is your magic
improving?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I've gotten much better since
you taught me the basics.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good. You have a special
gift for magic, Lilina.[A]
With enough practice,
you could be unrivaled.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. Just make sure you keep
up with your training.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will![A]
[04B7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]General Cecilia, why didn't you
teach magic to Roy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]When Roy was studying in Ostia,
you wouldn't teach him magic,[A]
no matter how much he asked.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah... You're right.
I didn't.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why not?
You taught me so much.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's partly because of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Because of me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right.[A]
Roy... You know how he is.[A]
If I'd taught him magic, he would
have practiced and practiced.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that sounds like him.
But...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, practice isn't enough to
master a school of magic.[A]
You need talent, and that can't
be obtained through practice.[A]
With another person of such talent
so close to him, what would he think?[A]
He'd work as hard--maybe even harder
than her,[A]
but he would still lag far behind.[A]
What would that do to his confidence?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That person of talent...
Do you mean me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Everyone has things they excel
at naturally.[A]
It was clear that Roy wouldn't
excel at magic,[A]
so I decided he would be better
off learning the sword instead.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Lilina, you will lead Ostia someday.
You should remember this...[A]
Assigning someone a task they do
not excel at is a waste of ability.[A]
You must never think that everyone
works in the same way.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, you're right...[A]
[04B8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCecilia][OpenMidRight][LoadLilina][OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, don't you think
Roy has changed recently?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]In what way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]He's gotten cool-headed...[A]
Or rather, he's more confident when
he gives commands to the army.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Anyone in charge of an army
gains traits like that.[A]
If Roy didn't grow, the army
would be doomed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]General Cecilia, you said before
that I would lead Ostia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are Lord Hector's
only heir after all.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you think I could be
like Roy? I mean...[A]
I couldn't even recognize
traitors in my own castle...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]People grow according to their
potential.[A]
Even I didn't know what to do at
first when I was made Mage General.[A]
I was taken from Ostia and brought
to Aquileia. It was overwhelming.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you succeeded
because of your talent...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's not what I'm getting at.[A]
I've only made it so far thanks
to Perceval and General Douglas.[A]
Don't think that you'll have to
do everything on your own.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Even Roy isn't fighting alone.[A]
He puts his faith in everyone
around him.[A]
That is another important
attribute for someone in power.[A]
The ability to depend on others
when you need them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Can I depend on you, too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course.[A]
I'll be glad to offer you
any help when you need it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you![A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your search led you to Zephiel?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes.[A]
I located Zephiel by following the
energy emitted by the demon dragon.[A]
I remember the exact words in the
conversation we had.[A]
"For what reason have you awakened
a demon dragon?" I asked him.[A]
He was a strange one. With a bored
look on his face, he simply asked,[A]
"Who are you?" to which I answered,
"Dragon."[A]
To that, a smile crept onto his
face.[A]
It was then he told me that he wanted
to give the world to the dragons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Frankly, I didn't trust him,[A]
but I accepted him as the new
leader of the demon dragon.[A]
He ordered it to liberate the
world from humans.[A]
He wanted it to rule the
world in their place.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Zephiel is dead now.
What is the demon dragon doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It is in this sanctuary, waiting for
its chance to liberate the world.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What?! Even with her
leader gone?![A]
Have you taken on the
role of leader now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is no need for that.[A]
Zephiel ordered it to proceed
even in the event of his death.[A]
Idunn will continue until control
is wrested from humans.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
She is nothing but a slave![A]
Her soul was destroyed and now
she's bound to a dead man's order![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you pity her as Hartmut did?[A]
...Foolish human. Your kind
makes no sense.[A]
Allow me to tell you one more
thing.[A]
No matter how you may want it,[A]
dragons and humans will never be
able to live in harmony.[A]
The differences between our two
species are simply too great.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's not true![A]
I know of a village where dragons
and humans live in peace![A]
I know a greater peace is
possible with effort![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Humans and dragons living
together?[A][Clear]
Stop your lies.[A]
I will not humor such an
obvious falsehood.[A][Clear]
Now, step forward. Let us see
whose strength is greater![A]

Bern surrendered.[A]
[0938]
Roy traversed underground passageway that
the Eight Heroes used to make their way[A]
to the Dragon Sanctuary.[A]
[0939]
However, Brenya, the last remaining
Dragon Lord of Bern, stood before him.[A]
[093A]
Bern as a nation was gone,
but its spirit was[A]
[093B]
not dead yet...[A]
[093C]

having to fight these ghosts...[A]
[093D]
Etruria
[093E]
Etruria was the other powerful kingdom
along with Bern. After debating about[A]
[093F]
about Guinivere's and Roy's position,
the Etrurian Court decided that they[A]
[0940]
had no reason to attack Bern as they
had not suffered a direct offense.[A]
[0941]
Guinivere was to stay under Etrurian
protection at Aquileia,[A]
[0942]
and the Lycia Alliance Army was to be
an independent squad under the Etrurian[A]
[0943]
military. To test his worth, Etruria
sent Roy to the Western Isles, where[A]
[0944]
his mission was to rid the islands of
the bandits terrorizing the people.[A]
[0945]
The Western Isles is an archipelago
under Etrurian protection lying to[A]
[0946]
the west of the mainland. Many
mining corporations have sprouted up[A]
[0947]
trying to monopolize the rich minerals
that lie in the islands' soil. However,[A]
the riches attracted many bandits, and the
people lived in constant fear of them...[A]

Fell in battle.
[0A6F]
Man and Dragon once coexisted in
harmony. However, Man shattered 
that harmony with a sudden onslaught.
A great war now known as The Scouring
was fought for dominion of the land.
Losses were tremendous for both sides
and this war rattled the very
foundations of the continent on
which they battled...
Defeated and humbled, the Dragons
disappeared from the realm.
Mankind then began to rebuild and 
repopulate their newly won land.
A millennium has passed since then...

that harmony with a sudden onslaught.
A great war now known as the Scouring
was fought for dominion of the land.
Losses were tremendous for both sides
and this war rattled the very
foundations of the continent on
which they battled...
Defeated and humbled, the dragons
disappeared from the realm.
Mankind then began to rebuild and 
repopulate their newly won land.
A millennium has passed since then...
[0A72]
The Scouring...
The great war between dragons and men...[A]
[0A73]
The dragons were defeated
and disappeared from Elibe...[A]
[0A74]
Mankind celebrated victory and then
spread their forces throughout the continent...[A]
[0A75]
1000 years have passed...[A]
[0A76]
After defeating the dragons,
the humans of Elibe quickly spread their[A]
culture and civilization to the farthest
reaches of the continent.[A]
[0A77]
In the west lies the Kingdom of
Etruria, which is widely considered to[A]
possess the most refined culture
in all of Elibe.[A]
[0A78]
The Kingdom of Bern, with its powerful
military and logical, pragmatic people,[A]
is located on the other side of
the continent in the east.[A]
[0A79]
These are the two most powerful nations
in Elibe with the weaker nations[A]
situated between them.
These smaller lands are...[A]
[0A7A]
the Lycian League, whose numerous
territories are independently ruled[A]
by a number of marquesses that are 
bound by a vow of allegianceア[A]
[0A7B]
Ilia, where the people arduously
till the frozen soil and many[A]
become mercenaries to earn
money to surviveア[A]
[0A7C]
and Sacae, where various clans ride
through the plains on horseback.[A]
[0A7D]
Although there were occasional clashes
between these nations, the majority[A]
of the people of Elibe lived in peace.
That peace, however, was not to last...[A]
[0A7E]
King Zephiel of Bern has commanded his
forces to conquer the entirety of Elibe.[A]
[0A7F]
Bern's armies first attacked Sacae and Ilia,
ruthlessly massacring all who opposed them.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, Bern is mounting a merciless
invasion into Lycia.[A]
[0A80]
Pherae is a territory of Lycia known for
its beauty and honorable lords.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Pherae's Lord Roy was studying in the great
territory of Ostia when the invasion began.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the sitting marquess and Roy's
father, Eliwood, who has been ill,[A]
has sent for Roy to return to lead Pherae's
soldiers in defending against Bern.[A]
[0A81]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Hector of Ostia is Eliwood's
long-time friend and confidant, and leads[A]
the council of lords in Lycia.
At the time Eliwood sent for Roy,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Ostia's daughter Lilina
was in Pherae visiting Eliwood.[A]
[0A82]
Upon receiving his father's message, Roy
hurries home, taking with him his vassals[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and Bors, a knight from Ostia who is
responsible for Lilina's safety.[A]
[0A83]
The story begins when Roy reaches
the outskirts of Pherae...[A]
[0A84]

[0A85]

[0A86]

[0A87]

[0A88]

[0A89]

[0A8A]
There is a small village on the border
of Pherae and Bern.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]This is where Roy is to meet the
mercenary band that Eliwood hired.[A]
[0A8B]
Just east of the village is a small castle
occupied by Bern's forces.[A]
At the time Roy reaches the village,
the castle is in an outright panic.[A]
Roy has yet to realize that this confusion
going on in the castle will spread,[A]
engulfing the entire continent of Elibe
in chaos...[A]
[0A8C]

[0A8D]

[0A8E]

[0A8F]
Just north of Pherae stands
Castle Araphen.[A]
The armies of Lycia had gathered here to
make preparations to strike back at Bern.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]However, when Roy and Guinivere are only a
short distance from Castle Araphen,[A]
a messenger brings them shocking
news they can scarcely believe.[A]
Leading Bern's army is a trio of elite
commanders known as the Wyvern Generals,[A]
named after the reptilian creatures native
to Bern for their ferocity and cunning.[A]
[0A90]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Two of these three, Brunnya and
Narcian, have attacked Castle Araphen,[A]
virtually decimating the Lycian Army
while it was little prepared.[A]
[0A91]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Morale of the group takes a blow, but
Roy continues to Castle Araphen,[A]
both to see it for himself and, hopefully,
find and aid any survivors...
[0A92]

[0A93]

[0A94]

[0A95]

[0A96]

[0A97]

[0A98]
Respecting Hector's dying request,
Roy makes his way west.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Intent on reaching Lilina, Roy
keeps a steady pace toward Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On his way there, Roy passes through
the territory of Laus,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]governed by Lord Erik.[A]
At a glance, Laus is a peaceful territory
with vast meadows and clear streams.[A]
Beneath this beauty, however, lies
treachery and great skullduggery...[A]
[0A99]
Marquess Laus had been working with
Bern against his allies in Lycia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy realizes that the leaders of Lycia, his
homeland, can no longer be trusted.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Still heading for Ostia, Roy moves through
a treacherous mountain pass...[A]
[0A9A]

[0A9B]

[0A9C]

[0A9D]

[0A9E]

[0A9F]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]After taking Saul, a priest of St. Elimine,
and Dorothy, his bodyguard, into their ranks,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company enter Thria,
southeast of Ostia.[A]
Thria is governed by Lord Orun,
Hector's cousin.[A]
[0AA0]
Orun's home castle seems a safe
place to stay.[A]
[0AA1]
As such, Roy expects a night of
quiet rest for his troops.[A]
However, even Thria is within Bern's
influence...[A]
[0AA2]

[0AA3]

[0AA4]

[0AA5]
Hearing of rebellion, Roy
hurries his pace towards Ostia.[A]
[0AA6]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to his information,
General Legance, an advisor to Hector,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]organized a rebellion with his lieutenant,
Debias, to surrender to Bern.[A]
[0AA7]
Legance keeps Lilina hostage in Castle
Ostia, thinking she may be of use later.[A]
[0AA8]
Roy and company enter Ostia in an
effort to rescue Lilina.[A]
[0AA9]
Ostia, the largest and most populous city
in Lycia, is to become a battlefield...[A]
[0AAA]

[0AAB]
Lilina has been taken hostage by Legance.[A]
She is imprisoned within Castle Ostia, because
Legance thought he might find a use for her.[A]
[0AAC]

[0AAD]

[0AAE]
Ostia's military primarily consists of
soldiers in heavy armor.[A]
With them, Castle Ostia has
always been famously secure.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]For countless years, the castle has
been said to be impregnable.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the rumors are about to be proven
wrong by Roy, who, ironically,[A]
only does so for the castle's
own protection...[A]
[0AAF]

[0AB0]

[0AB1]

[0AB2]

[0AB3]

[0AB4]

[0AB5]

[0AB6]

[0AB7]
Roy vowed to protect Lilina.[A]
With Bern coming full force however,
Roy's army is no equal.[A]
Therefore, he decides to try and
obtain a legendary weapon.[A]
He thinks it best to obtain it before
Bern manages to get their hands on it.[A]
Lilina shows them to a cave
on the outskirts of Ostia,[A]
where a legendary weapon is hidden.[A]
The cave, located at the foot of a volcano,
will be no small obstacle for Roy...[A]
[0AB8]

[0AB9]

[0ABA]
After driving Narcian away from Ostia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company brace themselves for
further attacks from Bern.[A]
However, Bern's belligerent movements
toward Lycia come to an abrupt halt,[A]
as if to mock Roy and his caution.[A]
Bern also remains unresponsive
to a treaty offer from Etruria.[A]
Bern's sudden silence and lack of
activity can only be described as eerie.[A]
[0ABB]
With Hector gone, Pherae is now the
greatest power in Lycia.[A]
Eliwood summons the council of marquesses
to Pherae to discuss future actions.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is decided that Eliwood is to lead
the council of the Lycian League.[A]
A new Lycian Army is also to
be established.[A]
This new army's purpose is not to
take the offensive against Bern,[A]
but rather take a defensive
stance for Lycia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Owing to his victory against Bern in Ostia,
Roy is chosen leader of this new army.[A]
Gradually, the attitude and morale in
Lycia begins to improve.[A]
People once again conduct business without
fear, and they embrace a new optimism.[A]
[0ABC]
At this time, Etruria calls for Lycia's
assistance.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom needs help with restoring
law to the Western Isles.[A]
Many outlaws make their bases there,
and anarchy is said to rule.[A]
[0ABD]
Many in Lycia are uneager to send their
troops to the Isles to deal with bandits,[A]
but having received Etruria's aid in Ostia,
they have no choice but to oblige.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Thus, Roy and the Lycian Army pass
through Etruria toward the Isles.[A]
[0ABE]
The Western Isles are the numerous
islands off the western coast of Elibe.[A]
Presently, they are colonies of Etruria.[A]
The Western Isles are rich in resources,
so mining is a major industry here.[A]
However, these resources are
worth a fortune.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Inevitably, varied bands of rogues traveled
there hoping to loot the mines.[A]
As such, the people of the Western Isles
live in constant fear of bandit attacks.[A]
Roy is sent to vanquish these bandits...[A]
[0ABF]
Roy accompanies Cecilia to the
Etrurian capital of Aquileia.[A]
[0AC0]
After debating Roy and Guinivere's positions,
the Etrurian Court hands down a decision.[A]
[0AC1]
They decide there is no justification to attack
Bern as they have not been attacked directly.[A]
[0AC2]
Guinivere is to stay under Etrurian
protection at Aquileia,[A]
and the Lycian Army is to be an independent
part of Etruria's military.
[0AC3]
To test his worth, Etruria sends Roy
to the Western Isles,[A]
[0AC4]
on a mission to rid the islands
of the spreading bandits.[A]
[0AC5]
The Western Isles is an archipelago to
the west under Etrurian jurisdiction.[A]
[0AC6]
Many mining companies have sprouted up to
take advantage of the rich resources there.[A]
[0AC7]
However, these riches also inevitably
attracted many bandits to the area,[A]
[0AC8]
and now the people live in
constant fear...[A]
[0AC9]

[0ACA]
Three separate islands:[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Fibernia,[A]
[0ACB]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Caldonia,[A]
[0ACC]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and Dia.[A]
All of these islands are rich in minerals,
and mining is the economic backbone.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The largest mine is located in
Eburacum, in north Fibernia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy leads his forces toward Eburacum
hoping to learn more about the bandits.[A]
[0ACD]
To get to Eburacum, one must pass a
castle located nearby.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy sends a messenger to Sir Nord,
lord of the castle,[A]
to request permission to
pass through his lands.[A]
Because Roy and company are in
the Isles on Etruria's request,[A]
they don't anticipate trouble in
gaining Nord's support.[A]
But not everything is as
simple as it appears...[A]
[0ACE]
Roy can hardly believe Larum's account.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He quickly pens a letter to Cecilia to let
her know of the horrors on the Isles.[A]
He also tells her of the actions he
plans to take from this point.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After sending the letter, Roy moves
towards the Eburacum mine.[A]
[0ACF]
His goal is to rescue the people
suffering from forced labor.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Etruria has assigned Bishop Orlo of the
St. Elimine Church to supervise the mine.[A]
It was already a fruitful endeavor, but
the nobles' greed is unsatiable.[A]
[0AD0]
Eburacum... Known now as the Mine of Death.[A]
The wails of the people forced into
labor echo through the mines,[A]
like the howling of ghosts,
never sleeping...[A]
[0AD1]

[0AD2]

[0AD3]

[0AD4]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In order to speak to the resistance
force about the bandits on the Isles,[A]
Roy and company move west along
the coastline.[A]
[0AD5]
Along the way, they come across
a small village caught in conflict.[A]
The local lord oppresses the resistance and
does anything he can to get rid of them...[A]
[0AD6]

[0AD7]

[0AD8]
The Lycian Army takes Elffin in
as an advisor.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following his advice, they move south
toward the isle of Caldonia.[A]
Caldonia is one of the main islands
that make up the Western Isles,[A]
the other two being Fibernia and Dia.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
[0AD9]
Castle Eidyna is located on Caldonia. Here,
men from all over the Isles are imprisoned,[A]
awaiting transport to Eburacum,
the Mine of Death.[A]
[0ADA]
When Roy arrives at Castle Eidyna,
the situation appears dire...[A]
[0ADB]

[0ADC]
To liberate the people of the Western Isles,
Roy heads for Juteaux,[A]
the Isles' largest city and its capital.[A]

[0ADD]
According to Elffin, Lord Arcardo, who is
in charge of overseeing the Western Isles,[A]
is an Etrurian of high nobility but of little
prominence in the Etrurian court.[A]
[0ADE]
Roy, still wary of how Etruria may
respond to his attack,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]prepares his soldiers to rid the Isles
of Arcardo to rescue the people...[A]
[0ADF]

[0AE0]

[0AE1]

[0AE2]

[0AE3]

[0AE4]
Following Elffin's guidance,[A]
Roy heads for a cave near Juteaux
to obtain a legendary weapon.[A]
[0AE5]
But Roy and company aren't the
only ones who know of the cave.[A]
Yet another battle awaits them...[A]
[0AE6]

[0AE7]

[0AE8]
The chaos caused by the coup in Aquileia
quickly spreads to the rest of Etruria.[A]
[0AE9]
Cecilia escapes with Guinivere
from Aquileia.[A]
She also forms a loyalist group to
combat the revolutionaries.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The revolutionaries, however,
have Bern on their side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]King Mordred has also been taken hostage,
giving the revolutionaries another edge:[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Great General Douglas and Knight General 
Perceval are forced into their service.[A]
With so much power, the revolutionaries
easily push the loyalists out of Etruria.[A]
[0AEA]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The loyalists are driven into an old
castle on the Missur Peninsula.[A]
[0AEB]
Roy learns that Cecilia has been
forced back by the revolutionaries.[A]
[0AEC]
In response, Roy heads for Missur.[A]
[0AED]
The loyalists are under attack by both
revolutionaries and Bern's military.[A]
With such adversity, the loyalists'
forces have little time...[A]
[0AEE]

[0AEF]

[0AF0]

[0AF1]

[0AF2]

[0AF3]
After Roy rescues Cecilia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]he obliges Sophia's request and
heads into the Nabata desert.[A]
[0AF4]
According to Sophia, her village,
Arcadia, is located in a hidden oasis.[A]
The village is under attack by Bern,[A]
and Roy believes their aim to be the
dragons said to inhabit the village.[A]

[0AF5]
The Lycian Army moves quickly to Arcadia,
but a sandstorm impedes their progress...[A]
[0AF6]
In the hidden village of Arcadia
stands an ancient temple.[A]
One of the legendary weapons
is said to be hidden within.[A]
Roy and company are hot on the
trail of Bern's troops,[A]
who have already made their
way into the temple...[A]
[0AF7]

[0AF8]

[0AF9]

[0AFA]
After saving the village of Arcadia,[A]
Roy's army leaves the desert by
following Igrene's lead.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, they turn toward Etruria to confront
the revolutionary forces.[A]

[0AFB]
However, they receive a troubling
letter from the elder of Arcadia.[A]

[0AFC]
Apparently, Fae the dragon has
left Arcadia in pursuit of Roy.[A]
If she falls into the hands of the
revolutionaries or Bern,[A]
there is no telling what might
happen to her, or to Roy's army.[A]

[0AFD]
Determined to find Fae, Roy moves to
a small fort on the Etrurian border...[A]
[0AFE]

[0AFF]

[0B00]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After rescuing Fae,
Roy heads for Aquileia.[A]
[0B01]
The capital of Etruria,[A]
Aquileia is also the largest and
wealthiest city on the continent.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Prepared for the Lycian Army's attack,[A]
the revolutionary forces are
fortified in Aquileia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The St. Elimine Church supports the Lycian
Army, turning popular opinion against[A]
the revolutionaries, forcing them
inside the castle.[A]
[0B02]
The St. Elimine Church was founded by Saint
Elimine, one of the Eight Legends.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The church has legions of followers,
particularly in Bern and Etruria.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy's attack on Aquileia is
supported by the church.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, Narcian and his elite troops
await Roy inside the castle...[A]

[0B03]

[0B04]

[0B05]

[0B06]

[0B07]

[0B08]

[0B09]
At the request of King Mordred, Roy heads
for the Saint's Tower outside Aquileia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Saint's Tower was once a place of
worship for Saint Elimine.[A]
In the tower lay numerous sacred relics
relating to her.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, this sacred tower is now
under the control of the revolutionaries.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Bishop Windham now occupies the tower after
betraying the St. Elimine Church...[A]
[0B0A]
After Roy captures Aquileia, other
Etrurian forces flock to the loyalists,[A]
forcing out the revolutionaries.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Roartz and Arcardo are driven out of
Etruria.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They flee north to Ilia,
which is under Bern's control.[A]
Ilia, the frozen highlands, is a
land with short summers and long winters.[A]
[0B0B]
With so little arable land,[A]
the nation's main source of
income is mercenary contracts.[A]
[0B0C]
The now free Kingdom of Etruria
joins forces with the Lycian Army.[A]
Now a joint force under the name of the
Etrurian Army,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]their first mission is to enter Ilia
and finish off the revolutionaries.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After that, they plan to launch a
direct attack on Bern.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy, nominated as leader of
the Etrurian Army,[A]
has the powerful support of
the St. Elimine Church.[A]
With the church's support comes
also the support of the people.[A]
[0B0D]
However, Roy has to face not only
the freezing cold of Ilia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]but also the elite troops under
Murdock, head of Bern's Wyvern Generals.[A]
Even worse, many skilled mercenary
knights of Ilia have sided with Bern.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To begin, Roy heads for Castle Remi,
located on the Ilian border...[A]
[0B0E]

[0B0F]

[0B10]

[0B11]

[0B12]

[0B13]

[0B14]

[0B15]

[0B16]

[0B17]
After defeating Arcardo, Roy moves
east, deep into the frozen lands of Ilia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He soon enters the thick forests
that characterize central Ilia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]However, a commander of Bern,
Bishop Martel, lies in wait.[A]
In his possession is an ancient spell
said to have been lost centuries ago...[A]

[0B18]

[0B19]

[0B1A]

[0B1B]

[0B1C]

[0B1D]
After defeating Martel and making it
through the woodlands,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy and company face the blizzards
common of Ilia's winters.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ilia's harsh weather has in the past served
as a natural defense against invaders.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]In this blizzard, Sigune, captain of a
pegasus knight squad working for Bern,[A]
makes preparations to attack
Roy and his troops...[A]
[0B1E]

[0B1F]

[0B20]

[0B21]

[0B22]
After defeating Sigune,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy heads for Edessa,
located in the northeast of Ilia.[A]
[0B23]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Castle Edessa, home of Zelot, leader of
the Ilian mercenary knights,[A]
once served as headquarters of the
pegasus knight mercenaries as well.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, with Zelot's absence, Bern saw
its chance and attacked the castle,[A]
forcing the mercenaries and pegasus
knights into submission.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Murdock had made the castle his base,
but after he returned to Bern,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]High Chancellor Roartz was put in charge.[A]
Alarmed by the Etrurian Army's
speedy advance to Edessa,[A]
Roartz hurriedly contacts the various
Ilian mercenary groups for aid.[A]
Unfortunately for him, however,
their replies are not promising...[A]

[0B2A]
After taking back Castle Edessa,[A]
Roy turns his troops toward the ancient
ruins on the outskirts of the town.[A]
A legendary weapon is said to be
hidden within...[A]

[0B2B]

[0B2C]

[0B2D]

[0B2E]
After Roy captures Aquileia, powers
in Etruria turn against the revolution.[A]
Driven away from the palace,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]Roartz and Arcardo flee to Sacae,
which remains under Bern's control.[A]
[0B2F]
Sacae lies in the center of the
continent and is covered in plains.[A]
Before Bern's invasion, it was
home to numerous nomadic clans.[A]
[0B30]
The Etrurian Army joins the Lycian
Army to form a unified force.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The decision is made for this army
to head for Sacae with dual purpose.[A]
The first is to eliminate the remnants
of the revolution,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and the second is to begin an
offensive against Bern.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Realizing that Etrurian soldiers may
not fight under the Lycian banner,[A]
Roy formally decides to call his
force the Etrurian Army.[A]
Roy is to lead the division that
will begin the offensive in Sacae.[A]
[0B31]
The people of Sacae are wary of
outsiders, which is challenge enough,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]but Brunnya, one of Bern's
three Wyvern Generals,[A]
has the Djute, the largest clan in
Sacae, under her control.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With the warriors of the Djute and
Brunnya's elite troops in his way,[A]
Roy knows it is unlikely he will find
any respite in this foreign land...[A]
[0B32]

[0B39]

[0B3A]

[0B3B]
After defeating Arcardo,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy crosses the border and
enters the land of Sacae.[A]
The Djute, the most powerful clan in
Sacae, serve Bern unbendingly.[A]
All clans who have stood against these
two joint forces have faced decimation.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The chieftain of the Kutolah clan,
the famed Silver Wolf Dayan,[A]
does lead a guerrilla resistance,
but to disappointingly little effect.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With none to oppose them, Bern essentially
has full control over Sacae.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As Roy sets foot on the plains,
the Djute wait to strike...[A]
[0B3C]

[0B3D]

[0B3E]

[0B3F]

[0B40]

[0B41]

[0B42]

[0B43]
After defeating the Djute,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy moves toward Bulgar,
the largest city in Sacae.[A]
[0B44]
As a center of commerce between
Etruria, Bern and Ilia,[A]
Bulgar has a history of being a
free city without rule.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, High Chancellor Roartz now holds
control of Bulgar with Bern's support.[A]
[0B45]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy enters Bulgar with the hopes of
liberating it and learning more...[A]
[0B46]

[0B47]

[0B48]
After Roy meets Niime the Hermit,
some light is shed on Bern's dragons.[A]
With many questions still left
unanswered,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy directs his troops towards a large
manor on the edge of Bulgar.[A]
[0B49]
Here, High Chancellor Roartz prepares
his defenses for his last stand...[A]
[0B4A]

[0B4B]
Roy heads toward the ruins in Sacae
hoping to secure a legendary weapon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]However, the remnants of the
Djute wait for Roy within...[A] 
[0B4C]

[0B4D]

[0B4E]
After surviving many hardships,
Roy finally sets foot on Bern's soil.[A]
[0B4F]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guinivere guides Roy to the
Shrine of Seals.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In their way stands Murdock, the brilliant
and stalwart head of the Wyvern Generals.[A]
[0B50]
Etruria and Bern, the two greatest forces
on the continent, begin direct warfare.[A]
The sun rises as the bloodiest day in
the history of Elibe dawns...[A]
[0B51]

[0B52]

[0B53]

[0B54]
Roy ventures into the depths of
the Shrine of Seals.[A]
Apparently, the shrine contains
more than just the Binding Blade.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]However, Peres, one of Murdock's best
commanders, waits for Roy within...[A]
[0B55]

[0B56]

[0B57]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After obtaining the Binding Blade,
Roy directs his troops to Bern's capital.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]
King Zephiel awaits within, along with
his personal guard.[A]
[0B58]
Roy prepares to charge the castle
to end the war,[A]
and to bring a long-awaited peace
back to Elibe...[A]
[0B59]

[0B5A]

[0B5B]

[0B5C]
Bern surrenders with King Zephiel's death.[A]
The great war that rattled the foundations
of Elibe is over.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]
Roy's battle, however, is not.[A]
[0B5D]
Roy continues his search for the Dark
Priestess, believed to be the demon dragon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following the legendary weapons' light,
Roy heads for the Dragon Sanctuary.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]However, waiting for Roy at the entrance
to the sanctuary is Brunnya,[A]
the last surviving Wyvern General
of Bern.[A]
With the remaining troops of Bern at her
command, she awaits Roy's approach.[A]
[0B5E]
With a heavy heart, Roy prepares to
fight the ghost of the now dead Bern...[A]

[0B60]

[OpenMidRight]I see...[A]
Juno was pretty worried about
you and Shanna.[A]
Knowing you, I would think you'd
be all right.[A]
But you know Juno,
she's a worrier.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I understand.[A]
Our sister was often too soft
on Shanna and me.[A]
The day we left was a hectic one,
indeed.[A]
Juno was constantly fretting over
us, worrying about our meals, and[A]
our clothes...[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Haha, that's Juno.[A]

After defeating Bern's remaining
troops, Roy enters the Dragon Sanctuary.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces][LoadOverworldFaces]He searches for the Dark Priestess
to prevent a repeat of the Scouring.[A]
[0B67]
Here in the sanctuary, Roy will learn
the truth of the legendary dragons.[A]
All he knows is about to be proven
wrong...[A]

Roy, son of the marquess of the

to become a worthy heir.[A][LoadOverworldFaces]

of the Kingdom of Etruria,[A]
